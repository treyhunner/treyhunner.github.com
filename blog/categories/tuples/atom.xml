    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Comparing things in Python.
That sounds like something that almost doesn&rsquo;t even need to be taught.
But I&rsquo;ve found that <strong>Python&rsquo;s comparison operators are often misunderstood and under-appreciated by newer Pythonistas</strong>.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s review how Python&rsquo;s comparison operators work on different types of objects and then take a look at how we can use this to improve the readability of our code.</p>

<ul data-toc=".entry-content"></ul>


<h2>Python&rsquo;s comparison operators</h2>

<p>By &ldquo;comparison operators&rdquo; I mean the equality operators (<code>==</code> and <code>!=</code>) and the ordering operators (<code>&lt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>).</p>

<p>We can use these operators to compare numbers, as you&rsquo;d expect:</p>

<pre><code class="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; 3 == 4
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; 3 != 4
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; 3 &lt; 4
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; 3 &gt; 4
False
</code></pre>

<p>But we can also use these operators to compare strings:</p>

<pre><code class="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; "pear" == "pickle"
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; "pear" != "pickle"
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; "pear" &lt; "pickle"
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; "pear" &gt; "pickle"
False
</code></pre>

<p>And even tuples:</p>

<pre><code class="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; target = (3, 6, 2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; installed = (3, 7, 0)
&gt;&gt;&gt; target == installed
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; target &lt;= installed
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; target &gt; installed
False
</code></pre>

<p>Many programming languages don&rsquo;t have an equivalent to Python&rsquo;s very flexible comparison operators.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll take a look at how these operators work on tuples and more complex objects in a moment, but we&rsquo;ll start with something simpler: string comparisons.</p>

<h2>String comparisons in Python</h2>

<p>Equality and inequality with strings is fairly simple.
If two strings have exactly the same characters, they&rsquo;re equal:</p>

<pre><code class="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; "hello" == "hello"
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; "hello" == "hella"
False
</code></pre>

<p>Note that I&rsquo;m glossing over a very big exception: unicode characters.
There are often multiple ways to represent the same text and those different representations must be <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unicodedata.html#unicodedata.normalize">normalized</a> before they&rsquo;re seen as equal.
For simplicity, we&rsquo;re going to stick to ASCII characters in this article.</p>

<p>Ordering of strings is where things get a bit interesting in Python:</p>

<pre><code class="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; "pickle" &lt; "python"
True
</code></pre>

<p>The string <code>"pickle"</code> is <em>less than</em> the string <code>"python"</code> because we&rsquo;re ordering alphabetically&hellip; sort of.
Capitalization matters:</p>

<pre><code class="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; "pickle" &lt; "Python"
False
</code></pre>

<p>The string <code>"Python"</code> is less than <code>"pickle"</code> because <code>P</code> is less than <code>p</code>.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re not actually ordering alphabetically here so much as <strong>ASCII-betically</strong> (unicode-betically really since we&rsquo;re in Python 3).
These strings are being ordered by the ASCII values of their characters (<code>p</code> is 112 in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters">ASCII</a> and <code>P</code> is 80).</p>

<pre><code class="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; ord("p")
112
&gt;&gt;&gt; ord("P")
80
&gt;&gt;&gt; "P" &lt; "p"
True
</code></pre>

<p>Technically Python compares the Unicode code point (which is what <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#ord">ord</a> does) for these characters and that happens to be the same as the ASCII value for ASCII characters.</p>

<p>The rules for ordering strings are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Compare the n-th characters of each string (starting with the first character, index <code>0</code>) using the <code>==</code> operator; if they&rsquo;re equal, repeat this step with the next character</li>
<li>For two unequal characters, take the character that has the lower code point and declare its string &ldquo;less than&rdquo; the other</li>
<li>If all characters are equal, the strings are equal</li>
<li>If one string runs out of characters during step 1 (one string is a &ldquo;prefix&rdquo; of the other), the shorter string is &ldquo;less than&rdquo; the longer one</li>
</ol>


<p>The ordering algorithm Python uses for strings might seem complicated, but it&rsquo;s <strong>very similar to the ordering algorithm used in dictionaries</strong>; not Python dictionaries but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary">physical dictionaries</a> (those things we used before the Internet existed).
We give precedence to the first characters when ordering words in dictionaries and if one word is a prefix of another, it comes first.</p>

<h2>Tuple comparisons</h2>

<p>We can ask tuples if they&rsquo;re equal, just as we can ask strings if they&rsquo;re equal:</p>

<pre><code class="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; (3, 6, 2) == (3, 6, 2)
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; (3, 6, 2) == (3, 7, 0)
False
</code></pre>

<p>But we can also compare tuples using the ordering operators (<code>&lt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>):</p>

<pre><code class="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; (3, 6, 2) &lt; (3, 6, 2)
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; (3, 6, 2) &lt;= (3, 6, 2)
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; (3, 6, 2) &lt; (3, 7, 0)
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; (3, 6, 2) &gt;= (3, 7, 0)
False
</code></pre>

<p>String ordering might have been somewhat intuitive (most of us learned alphabetical ordering before Python), but tuple ordering doesn&rsquo;t often feel quite as intuitive at first.
But you&rsquo;re actually somewhat familiar with tuple ordering already because <strong>tuple ordering uses the same algorithm as string ordering</strong>.</p>

<p>The rules for ordering tuples (which are essentially the same as ordering strings):</p>

<ol>
<li>Compare the n-th items of each tuple (starting with the first, index <code>0</code>) using the <code>==</code> operator; if they&rsquo;re equal, repeat this step with the next item</li>
<li>For two unequal items, the item that is &ldquo;less than&rdquo; makes the tuple that contains it also &ldquo;less than&rdquo; the other tuple</li>
<li>If all items are equal, the tuples are equal</li>
<li>If one tuple runs out of items during step 1 (one tuple is a &ldquo;prefix&rdquo; of the other), the shorter tuple is &ldquo;less than&rdquo; the longer one</li>
</ol>


<p>In Python, this algorithm might look sort of like this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">def less_than(tuple1, tuple2):
    for x, y in zip(tuple1, tuple2):
        if x == y:
            continue
        return (x &lt; y)
    if len(tuple1) &lt; len(tuple2):
        return True  # There were more items in the second tuple
    else:
        return False  # The first tuple had more items or they are equal
</code></pre>

<p>Note that we&rsquo;d never write code like this because Python is doing all this work for us already.
That whole function is the same as using the <code>&lt;</code> operator:</p>

<pre><code class="python">def less_than(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple1 &lt; tuple2
</code></pre>

<h2>Lexicographical ordering</h2>

<p>This <strong>alphabetical-like style of ordering</strong> that gives precedence to the first items in an iterable is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographical_order">lexicographical ordering</a>.
You don&rsquo;t need to know that phrase, but if you ever need to describe <em>the way ordering works in Python</em>, <strong>lexicographical</strong> is the word to use.</p>

<p>Strings and tuples are ordered lexicographically, as we&rsquo;ve seen, but so are lists:</p>

<pre><code class="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; [1, 2, 3] &lt; [1, 4]
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; [1, 2, 3] &lt; [1, 2, 2]
False
</code></pre>

<p>In fact, most <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-sequence">sequences</a> in Python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#comparing-sequences-and-other-types">should be ordered lexicographically</a> (<code>range</code> objects are an exception to this as they can&rsquo;t be ordered at all).</p>

<p>But not every collection in Python relies on lexicographical ordering.</p>

<h2>Dictionary and set comparisons</h2>

<p>Many objects in Python work with equality but don&rsquo;t work with ordering at all.</p>

<p>For example dictionaries compare &ldquo;equal&rdquo; when they have all the same keys and values:</p>

<pre><code class="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; expected = {'name': 'Trey', 'python_version': '3.7.0'}
&gt;&gt;&gt; actual = {'name': 'Trey', 'python_version': '2.7.0'}
&gt;&gt;&gt; expected == actual
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; actual['python_version'] = '3.7.0'
&gt;&gt;&gt; expected == actual
True
</code></pre>

<p>But <strong>dictionaries can&rsquo;t be ordered</strong> using the <code>&lt;</code> or <code>&gt;</code> operators:</p>

<pre><code class="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; expected &lt; actual
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: '&lt;' not supported between instances of 'dict' and 'dict'
</code></pre>

<p>Sets are similar, except that sets <em>do</em> work with ordering operators&hellip; they just don&rsquo;t use those operators for ordering:</p>

<pre><code class="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; {1, 2} &lt; {1, 2, 3}
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; {1, 3} &lt; {1, 2, 4}
False
</code></pre>

<p>Sets overload these operators to answer questions about <strong>whether one set is a subset or superset of another</strong> (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/stdtypes.html#set-types-set-frozenset">see sets in the documentation</a>).</p>

<h2>Deep equality</h2>

<p>Comparisons between two data structures in Python tend to be <strong>deep comparisons</strong>.
Whether we&rsquo;re comparing lists, tuples, sets, or dictionaries, when we ask whether two of these objects are &ldquo;equal&rdquo; Python will recurse through each sub-object and ask whether each is &ldquo;equal&rdquo;.</p>

<p>So given a dictionary that maps tuples to lists of tuples:</p>

<pre><code class="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; current_portals = {(1, 2): [(2, 1)], (2, 1): [(1, 2), (3, 4)]}
&gt;&gt;&gt; previous_portals = {(1, 2): [(2, 1)], (2, 1): [(1, 2)]}
</code></pre>

<p>Asking whether these two dictionaries are equal is equivalent to asking whether each key-value pair is equal, recursively:</p>

<pre><code class="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; current_portals == previous_portals
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; current_portals[2, 1].pop()
(3, 4)
&gt;&gt;&gt; current_portals == previous_portals
True
</code></pre>

<p>The dictionaries ask each of their keys &ldquo;are you in the other dictionary&rdquo; and then asks each of the corresponding values for those keys &ldquo;are you equal to the other value&rdquo;.
But each of these operations may (as in this case) require another level of depth: the keys are tuples which need to be traversed and the values are lists which need to be traversed.
And in this case those values, the lists, need to be traversed even deeper because they contain more data structures: tuples.</p>

<p><strong>We don&rsquo;t have to worry about any of this though</strong>: Python just does these deep comparisons for us automatically.</p>

<p>While you don&rsquo;t need to worry about how deep comparisons work, the fact that Python&rsquo;s comparisons <em>are</em> deep can be pretty handy to know.</p>

<p>For example if we have <a href="https://pastebin.com/raw/yspKmfyj">a class</a> with <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code> attributes we&rsquo;d like to compare in our <code>__eq__</code> method, instead of this long boolean expression:</p>

<pre><code class="python">def __eq__(self, other):
    return self.x == other.x and self.y == other.y and self.z == other.z
</code></pre>

<p>We could bundle these values into 3-item tuples and compare them that way instead:</p>

<pre><code class="python">def __eq__(self, other):
    return (self.x, self.y, self.z) == (other.x, other.y, other.z)
</code></pre>

<p>I find this more readable, mostly because <strong>we&rsquo;ve added symmetry to our code</strong>: we have one <code>==</code> expression with the same kind of object on each side of it.</p>

<h2>Deep ordering</h2>

<p>This &ldquo;deep comparison&rdquo; works for equality, but it also works for ordering.</p>

<p>The use case for deep ordering isn&rsquo;t as obvious as for deep equality, but identifying places where deep ordering is handy can help you drastically improve the readability of your code.</p>

<p>Take this example method:</p>

<pre><code class="python">def __lt__(self, other):
    if self.last_name &lt; other.last_name:
        return True
    elif other.last_name &lt; self.last_name:
        return False
    elif self.first_name &lt; other.first_name:
        return True
    else:
        return False
</code></pre>

<p>This <code>__lt__</code> method implements the <code>&lt;</code> operator on <a href="https://pastebin.com/raw/u8uGDArq">its class</a>, returning <code>True</code> if <code>self</code> is less than <code>other</code>.
Storing and comparing <code>first_name</code> and <code>last_name</code> attributes this way is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=458KmAKq0bQ&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=148">an anti-pattern</a> but we&rsquo;ll ignore that fact for this example.</p>

<p>That <code>__lt__</code> method above gives precedence to the <code>last_name</code>: the <code>first_name</code> is only checked if the <code>last_name</code> attribute of these two objects happens to be equal.</p>

<p>If we wanted to collapse this logic some, we could rewrite our code like this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">def __lt__(self, other):
    return (
        self.last_name &lt; other.last_name or
        self.last_name == other.last_name and self.first_name &lt; other.first_name
    )
</code></pre>

<p>Or&hellip; we could rely on the deep ordering of tuples instead:</p>

<pre><code class="python">def __lt__(self, other):
    return (self.last_name, self.first_name) &lt; (other.last_name, other.first_name)
</code></pre>

<p>Here we&rsquo;re ordering our tuples lexicographically (by their first item first).
Our tuples happen to contain strings, which are also ordered lexicographically (by their first character first).
So we&rsquo;re <strong>deeply ordering</strong> these objects.</p>

<h2>Sorting by multiple attributes at once</h2>

<p>Knowing about lexicographical ordering and deep ordering of Python sequences can be quite useful when sorting Python objects.
From Python&rsquo;s perspective, <strong>sorting is really just ordering over and over</strong>.</p>

<p>Python&rsquo;s built-in <code>sorted</code> function accepts a <code>key</code> function which can return a corresponding key object to sort each of these items by.</p>

<p>Here we&rsquo;re specifying a <code>key</code> function that accepts a word and returns a tuple of two things: the length of the word and the case-normalized word:</p>

<pre><code class="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; fruits = ['kumquat', 'Cherimoya', 'Loquat', 'longan', 'jujube']
&gt;&gt;&gt; def length_and_word(word): return (len(word), word.casefold())
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; sorted(fruits, key=length_and_word)
['jujube', 'longan', 'Loquat', 'kumquat', 'Cherimoya']
</code></pre>

<p>With the key function above we&rsquo;re able to sort fruits first by their length and <em>then</em> by their case-normalized equivalent.
So &ldquo;jujube&rdquo; comes first because it&rsquo;s 6 letters (like <code>longan</code> and <code>Loquat</code>) but it&rsquo;s also alphabetically before <code>longan</code> and <code>Loquat</code>.</p>

<p>If we just sorted by length we would have had a different ordering:</p>

<pre><code class="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; sorted(fruits, key=len)
['Loquat', 'longan', 'jujube', 'kumquat', 'Cherimoya']
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Slight aside</strong>: deep comparisons actually predate the <code>sorted</code> function&rsquo;s <code>key</code> argument in Python.
Before there was a key function Python developers would create lists of tuples, sort the lists of tuples, and then grab the actual value they cared about out of that list (which is <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html#the-old-way-using-decorate-sort-undecorate">discussed in the docs</a>).</p>

<p>The <code>sorted</code> function isn&rsquo;t the only place where tuple ordering can come in handy.
Any place where you see a <code>key</code> function might be a candidates for relying on tuple ordering.
For example the <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> functions:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; min(fruits, key=str.casefold)
'Cherimoya'
&gt;&gt;&gt; max(fruits, key=str.casefold)
'Loquat'
</code></pre>

<p>Anywhere Python does an ordering operation might be a place you could rely on the deep ordering of Python&rsquo;s data structures.</p>

<h2>Deep hashability (and unhashability)</h2>

<p>Python has both deep equality and deep orderability.
But Python&rsquo;s deep comparisons don&rsquo;t stop there: there&rsquo;s also deep hashability.</p>

<p>This is something that mostly comes up with tuples.
Tuples can be used as a key in a dictionary (as we saw earlier), and they can be used in sets:</p>

<pre><code class="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; current_portals = {(1, 2): [(2, 1)], (2, 1): [(1, 2), (3, 4)]}
&gt;&gt;&gt; points = {(1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 4)}
</code></pre>

<p>But this only works for tuples that contain immutable values:</p>

<pre><code class="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; things = {(["dress", "truck"], "yellow"), (["ball", "plane"], "purple")}
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'
</code></pre>

<p>Tuples with lists in them aren&rsquo;t hashable because lists aren&rsquo;t hashable: each object inside a tuple must be hashable for the tuple itself to be hashable.</p>

<p>So while tuples containing lists aren&rsquo;t hashable, tuples containing tuples <em>are</em> hashable:</p>

<pre><code class="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; things = {(("dress", "truck"), "yellow"), (("ball", "plane"), "purple")}
&gt;&gt;&gt; things
{(('dress', 'truck'), 'yellow'), (('ball', 'plane'), 'purple')}
</code></pre>

<p>Tuples compute their hash values by delegating to the hash values of the items they contain:</p>

<pre><code class="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; x = (1, 2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; y = (1, 2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; hash(x)
3713081631934410656
&gt;&gt;&gt; hash(x) == hash(y)
True
</code></pre>

<p>While hashability is a big subject, this is really all I&rsquo;m going to say about it.
You don&rsquo;t really need to know how hashing works in Python so if you found this section confusing, that&rsquo;s okay!</p>

<p>The takeaway here is that Python supports <strong>deep hashability</strong> which is <strong>the reason we can use tuples as dictionary keys</strong> and the reason we can use tuples in sets.</p>

<h2>Deep comparisons are a tool to remember</h2>

<p>When you have code that compares two objects based on subparts in a particular order:</p>

<pre><code class="python">d1 = (1999, 12, 31)
d2 = (1999, 12, 1)
if d1[0] &gt; d2[0]:
    greater = d1
elif d1[0] &lt; d2[0]:
    greater = d2
elif d1[1] &gt; d2[1]:
    greater = d1
elif d1[1] &lt; d2[1]:
    greater = d2
elif d1[2] &gt; d2[2]:
    greater = d1
else:
    greater = d2
</code></pre>

<p>You could probably rely on tuple ordering instead:</p>

<pre><code class="python">d1 = (1999, 12, 31)
d2 = (1999, 12, 1)
if d1 &lt; d2:
    greater = d1
else:
    greater = d2
</code></pre>

<p>If you are comparing many different things as equal:</p>

<pre><code class="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; d1 = (1999, 12, 31)
&gt;&gt;&gt; d2 = (1999, 12, 1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; d1[0] == d2[0] and d1[1] == d2[1] and d1[2] == d2[2]
False
</code></pre>

<p>You could probably rely on deep equality instead:</p>

<pre><code class="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; d1 = (1999, 12, 31)
&gt;&gt;&gt; d2 = (1999, 12, 1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; d1 == d2
False
</code></pre>

<p>And if you need to use a dictionary that has a key made up of multiple parts, if those parts are each hashable, you could probably use a tuple:</p>

<pre><code class="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; points = {}
&gt;&gt;&gt; points[1, 2] = 'red'
&gt;&gt;&gt; points
{(1, 2): 'red'}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Python&rsquo;s support for lexicographical ordering and deep comparisons is often overlooked by folks moving from other programming languages</strong>.
Remember these features: you may not need them today, but they&rsquo;ll almost certainly come in handy at some point.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Whether I&rsquo;m teaching new Pythonistas or long-time Python programmers, I frequently find that <strong>Python programmers underutilize multiple assignment</strong>.</p>

<p>Multiple assignment (also known as tuple unpacking or iterable unpacking) allows you to assign multiple variables at the same time in one line of code.
This feature often seems simple after you&rsquo;ve learned about it, but <strong>it can be tricky to recall multiple assignment when you need it most</strong>.</p>

<p>In this article we&rsquo;ll see what multiple assignment is, we&rsquo;ll take a look at common uses of multiple assignment, and then we&rsquo;ll look at a few uses for multiple assignment that are often overlooked.</p>

<p>Note that in this article I will be using <a href="https://cito.github.io/blog/f-strings/">f-strings</a> which are a Python 3.6+ feature.
If you&rsquo;re on an older version of Python, you&rsquo;ll need to mentally translate those to use the string <code>format</code> method.</p>

<ul data-toc=".entry-content"></ul>


<h2>How multiple assignment works</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be using the words <strong>multiple assignment</strong>, <strong>tuple unpacking</strong>, and <strong>iterable unpacking</strong> interchangeably in this article.
They&rsquo;re all just different words for the same thing.</p>

<p>Python&rsquo;s multiple assignment looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; x, y = 10, 20
</code></pre>

<p>Here we&rsquo;re setting <code>x</code> to <code>10</code> and <code>y</code> to <code>20</code>.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s happening at a lower level is that we&rsquo;re creating a tuple of <code>10, 20</code> and then looping over that tuple and taking each of the two items we get from looping and assigning them to <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> in order.</p>

<p>This syntax might make that a bit more clear:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; (x, y) = (10, 20)
</code></pre>

<p>Parenthesis are optional around tuples in Python and they&rsquo;re also optional in multiple assignment (which uses a tuple-like syntax).
All of these are equivalent:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; x, y = 10, 20
&gt;&gt;&gt; x, y = (10, 20)
&gt;&gt;&gt; (x, y) = 10, 20
&gt;&gt;&gt; (x, y) = (10, 20)
</code></pre>

<p>Multiple assignment is often called &ldquo;tuple unpacking&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s frequently used with tuples.
But we can use multiple assignment with any iterable, not just tuples.
Here we&rsquo;re using it with a list:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; x, y = [10, 20]
&gt;&gt;&gt; x
10
&gt;&gt;&gt; y
20
</code></pre>

<p>And with a string:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; x, y = 'hi'
&gt;&gt;&gt; x
'h'
&gt;&gt;&gt; y
'i'
</code></pre>

<p>Anything that can be looped over can be &ldquo;unpacked&rdquo; with tuple unpacking / multiple assignment.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s another example to demonstrate that multiple assignment works with any number of items and that it works with variables as well as objects we&rsquo;ve just created:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; point = 10, 20, 30
&gt;&gt;&gt; x, y, z = point
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(x, y, z)
10 20 30
&gt;&gt;&gt; (x, y, z) = (z, y, x)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(x, y, z)
30 20 10
</code></pre>

<p>Note that on that last line we&rsquo;re actually swapping variable names, which is something multiple assignment allows us to do easily.</p>

<p>Alright, let&rsquo;s talk about how multiple assignment can be used.</p>

<h2>Unpacking in a for loop</h2>

<p>You&rsquo;ll commonly see multiple assignment used in <code>for</code> loops.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a dictionary:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; person_dictionary = {'name': "Trey", 'company': "Truthful Technology LLC"}
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of looping over our dictionary like this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">for item in person_dictionary.items():
    print(f"Key {item[0]} has value {item[1]}")
</code></pre>

<p>You&rsquo;ll often see Python programmers use multiple assignment by writing this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">for key, value in person_dictionary.items():
    print(f"Key {key} has value {value}")
</code></pre>

<p>When you write the <code>for X in Y</code> line of a for loop, you&rsquo;re telling Python that it should do an assignment to <code>X</code> for each iteration of your loop.
Just like in an assignment using the <code>=</code> operator, we can use multiple assignment here.</p>

<p>This:</p>

<pre><code class="python">for key, value in person_dictionary.items():
    print(f"Key {key} has value {value}")
</code></pre>

<p>Is essentially the same as this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">for item in person_dictionary.items():
    key, value = item
    print(f"Key {key} has value {value}")
</code></pre>

<p>We&rsquo;re just not doing an unnecessary extra assignment in the first example.</p>

<p>So multiple assignment is great for unpacking dictionary items into key-value pairs, but it&rsquo;s helpful in many other places too.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s great when paired with the built-in <code>enumerate</code> function:</p>

<pre><code class="python">for i, line in enumerate(my_file):
    print(f"Line {i}: {line}")
</code></pre>

<p>And the <code>zip</code> function:</p>

<pre><code class="python">for color, ratio in zip(colors, ratios):
    print(f"It's {ratio*100}% {color}.")
</code></pre>



<pre><code class="python">for (product, price, color) in zip(products, prices, colors):
    print(f"{product} is {color} and costs ${price:.2f}")
</code></pre>

<p>If you&rsquo;re unfamiliar with <code>enumerate</code> or <code>zip</code>, see my article on <a href="http://treyhunner.com/2016/04/how-to-loop-with-indexes-in-python/">looping with indexes in Python</a>.</p>

<p>Newer Pythonistas often see multiple assignment in the context of <code>for</code> loops and sometimes assume it&rsquo;s tied to loops.  Multiple assignment works for any assignment though, not just loop assignments.</p>

<h2>An alternative to hard coded indexes</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s not uncommon to see hard coded indexes (e.g. <code>point[0]</code>, <code>items[1]</code>, <code>vals[-1]</code>) in code:</p>

<pre><code class="python">print(f"The first item is {items[0]} and the last item is {items[-1]}")
</code></pre>

<p>When you see Python code that uses hard coded indexes there&rsquo;s often a way to <strong>use multiple assignment to make your code more readable</strong>.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s some code that has three hard coded indexes:</p>

<pre><code class="python">def reformat_date(mdy_date_string):
    """Reformat MM/DD/YYYY string into YYYY-MM-DD string."""
    date = mdy_date_string.split('/')
    return f"{date[2]}-{date[0]}-{date[1]}"
</code></pre>

<p>We can make this code much more readable by using multiple assignment to assign separate month, day, and year variables:</p>

<pre><code class="python">def reformat_date(mdy_date_string):
    """Reformat MM/DD/YYYY string into YYYY-MM-DD string."""
    month, day, year = mdy_date_string.split('/')
    return f"{year}-{month}-{day}"
</code></pre>

<p>Whenever you see hard coded indexes in your code, stop to consider whether you could use multiple assignment to make your code more readable.</p>

<h2>Multiple assignment is very strict</h2>

<p>Multiple assignment is actually fairly strict when it comes to unpacking the iterable we give to it.</p>

<p>If we try to unpack a larger iterable into a smaller number of variables, we&rsquo;ll get an error:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; x, y = (10, 20, 30)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 2)
</code></pre>

<p>If we try to unpack a smaller iterable into a larger number of variables, we&rsquo;ll also get an error:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; x, y, z = (10, 20)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 3, got 2)
</code></pre>

<p>This strictness is pretty great.
If we&rsquo;re working with an item that has a different size than we expected, the multiple assignment will fail loudly and we&rsquo;ll hopefully now know about a bug in our program that we weren&rsquo;t yet aware of.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at an example.
Imagine that we have a short command line program that parses command-line arguments in a rudimentary way, like this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">import sys

new_file = sys.argv[1]
old_file = sys.argv[2]
print(f"Copying {new_file} to {old_file}")
</code></pre>

<p>Our program is supposed to accept 2 arguments, like this:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ my_program.py file1.txt file2.txt
Copying file1.txt to file2.txt
</code></pre>

<p>But if someone called our program with three arguments, they will not see an error:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ my_program.py file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
Copying file1.txt to file2.txt
</code></pre>

<p>There&rsquo;s no error because we&rsquo;re not validating that we&rsquo;ve received exactly 2 arguments.</p>

<p>If we use multiple assignment instead of hard coded indexes, the assignment will verify that we receive exactly the expected number of arguments:</p>

<pre><code class="python">import sys

_, new_file, old_file = sys.argv
print(f"Copying {new_file} to {old_file}")
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: we&rsquo;re using the variable name <code>_</code> to note that we don&rsquo;t care about <code>sys.argv[0]</code> (the name of our program).
Using <code>_</code> for variables you don&rsquo;t care about is just a convention.</p>

<h2>An alternative to slicing</h2>

<p>So multiple assignment can be used for avoiding hard coded indexes and it can be used to ensure we&rsquo;re strict about the size of the tuples/iterables we&rsquo;re working with.</p>

<p>Multiple assignment can be used to replace hard coded slices too!</p>

<p>Slicing is a handy way to grab a specific portion of the items in lists and other sequences.</p>

<p>Here are some slices that are &ldquo;hard coded&rdquo; in that they only use numeric indexes:</p>

<pre><code class="python">all_after_first = items[1:]
all_but_last_two = items[:-2]
items_with_ends_removed = items[1:-1]
</code></pre>

<p>Whenever you see slices that don&rsquo;t use any variables in their slice indexes, you can often use multiple assignment instead.
To do this we have to talk about a feature that I haven&rsquo;t mentioned yet: the <code>*</code> operator.</p>

<p>In Python 3.0, the <code>*</code> operator was added to the multiple assignment syntax, allowing us to capture remaining items after an unpacking into a list:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
&gt;&gt;&gt; first, *rest = numbers
&gt;&gt;&gt; rest
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
&gt;&gt;&gt; first
1
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>*</code> operator allows us to replace hard coded slices near the ends of sequences.</p>

<p>These two lines are equivalent:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; beginning, last = numbers[:-1], numbers[-1]
&gt;&gt;&gt; *beginning, last = numbers
</code></pre>

<p>These two lines are equivalent also:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; head, middle, tail = numbers[0], numbers[1:-1], numbers[-1]
&gt;&gt;&gt; head, *middle, tail = numbers
</code></pre>

<p>With the <code>*</code> operator and multiple assignment you can replace things like this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">main(sys.argv[0], sys.argv[1:])
</code></pre>

<p>With more descriptive code, like this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">program_name, *arguments = sys.argv
main(program_name, arguments)
</code></pre>

<p>So if you see hard coded slice indexes in your code, consider whether you could use multiple assignment to clarify what those slices really represent.</p>

<h2>Deep unpacking</h2>

<p>This next feature is something that long-time Python programmers often overlook.
It doesn&rsquo;t come up quite as often as the other uses for multiple assignment that I&rsquo;ve discussed, but it can be very handy to know about when you do need it.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve seen multiple assignment for unpacking tuples and other iterables.
We haven&rsquo;t yet seen that this is can be done <em>deeply</em>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d say that the following multiple assignment is <em>shallow</em> because it unpacks one level deep:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; color, point = ("red", (1, 2, 3))
&gt;&gt;&gt; color
'red'
&gt;&gt;&gt; point
(1, 2, 3)
</code></pre>

<p>And I&rsquo;d say that this multiple assignment is <em>deep</em> because it unpacks the previous <code>point</code> tuple further into <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code> variables:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; color, (x, y, z) = ("red", (1, 2, 3))
&gt;&gt;&gt; color
'red'
&gt;&gt;&gt; x
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; y
2
</code></pre>

<p>If it seems confusing what&rsquo;s going on above, maybe using parenthesis consistently on both sides of this assignment will help clarify things:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; (color, (x, y, z)) = ("red", (1, 2, 3))
</code></pre>

<p>We&rsquo;re unpacking one level deep to get two objects, but then we take the second object and unpack it also to get 3 more objects.
Then we assign our first object and our thrice-unpacked second object to our new variables (<code>color</code>, <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code>).</p>

<p>Take these two lists:</p>

<pre><code class="python">start_points = [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)]
end_points = [(-1, -2), (-3, 4), (-6, -5)]
</code></pre>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of code that works with these lists by using shallow unpacking:</p>

<pre><code class="python">for start, end in zip(start_points, end_points):
    if start[0] == -end[0] and start[1] == -end[1]:
        print(f"Point {start[0]},{start[1]} was negated.")
</code></pre>

<p>And here&rsquo;s the same thing with deeper unpacking:</p>

<pre><code class="python">for (x1, y1), (x2, y2) in zip(start_points, end_points):
    if x1 == -x2 and y1 == -y2:
        print(f"Point {x1},{y1} was negated.")
</code></pre>

<p>Note that in this second case, it&rsquo;s much more clear what type of objects we&rsquo;re working with.
The deep unpacking makes it apparent that we&rsquo;re receiving two 2-itemed tuples each time we loop.</p>

<p>Deep unpacking often comes up when nesting looping utilities that each provide multiple items.
For example, you may see deep multiple assignments when using <code>enumerate</code> and <code>zip</code> together:</p>

<pre><code class="python">items = [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 1]
for i, (first, last) in enumerate(zip(items, reversed(items))):
    if first != last:
        raise ValueError(f"Item {i} doesn't match: {first} != {last}")
</code></pre>

<p>I said before that multiple assignment is strict about the size of our iterables as we unpack them.
With deep unpacking we can also be <strong>strict about the shape of our iterables</strong>.</p>

<p>This works:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; points = ((1, 2), (-1, -2))
&gt;&gt;&gt; points[0][0] == -points[1][0] and points[0][1] == -points[1][1]
True
</code></pre>

<p>But this buggy code works too:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; points = ((1, 2, 4), (-1, -2, 3), (6, 4, 5))
&gt;&gt;&gt; points[0][0] == -points[1][0] and points[0][1] == -points[1][1]
True
</code></pre>

<p>Whereas this works:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; points = ((1, 2), (-1, -2))
&gt;&gt;&gt; (x1, y1), (x2, y2) = points
&gt;&gt;&gt; x1 == -x2 and y1 == -y2
True
</code></pre>

<p>But this does not:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; points = ((1, 2, 4), (-1, -2, 3), (6, 4, 5))
&gt;&gt;&gt; (x1, y1), (x2, y2) = points
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 2)
</code></pre>

<p>With multiple assignment we&rsquo;re assigning variables while also making particular assertions about the size and shape of our iterables.
Multiple assignment will help you clarify your code to both humans (for <strong>better code readability</strong>) and to computers (for <strong>improved code correctness</strong>).</p>

<h2>Using a list-like syntax</h2>

<p>I noted before that multiple assignment uses a tuple-like syntax, but it works on any iterable.
That tuple-like syntax is the reason it&rsquo;s commonly called &ldquo;tuple unpacking&rdquo; even though it might be more clear to say &ldquo;iterable unpacking&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t mention before that multiple assignment also works with <strong>a list-like syntax</strong>.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a multiple assignment with a list-like syntax:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; [x, y, z] = 1, 2, 3
&gt;&gt;&gt; x
1
</code></pre>

<p>This might seem really strange. What&rsquo;s the point of allowing both list-like and tuple-like syntaxes?</p>

<p>I use this feature rarely, but I find it helpful for <strong>code clarity</strong> in specific circumstances.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say I have code that used to look like this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">def most_common(items):
    return Counter(items).most_common(1)[0][0]
</code></pre>

<p>And our well-intentioned coworker has decided to use deep multiple assignment to refactor our code to this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">def most_common(items):
    (value, times_seen), = Counter(items).most_common(1)
    return value
</code></pre>

<p>See that trailing comma on the left-hand side of the assignment?
It&rsquo;s easy to miss and it makes this code look sort of weird.
What is that comma even doing in this code?</p>

<p>That trailing comma is there to make a single item tuple.
We&rsquo;re doing deep unpacking here.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s another way we could write the same code:</p>

<pre><code class="python">def most_common(items):
    ((value, times_seen),) = Counter(items).most_common(1)
    return value
</code></pre>

<p>This might make that deep unpacking a little more obvious but I&rsquo;d prefer to see this instead:</p>

<pre><code class="python">def most_common(items):
    [(value, times_seen)] = Counter(items).most_common(1)
    return value
</code></pre>

<p>The list-syntax in our assignment makes it more clear that we&rsquo;re unpacking a one-item iterable and then unpacking that single item into <code>value</code> and <code>times_seen</code> variables.</p>

<p>When I see this, I also think <em>I bet we&rsquo;re unpacking a single-item list</em>.
And that is in fact what we&rsquo;re doing.
We&rsquo;re using a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter">Counter</a> object from the collections module here.
The <code>most_common</code> method on <code>Counter</code> objects allows us to limit the length of the list returned to us.
We&rsquo;re limiting the list we&rsquo;re getting back to just a single item.</p>

<p>When you&rsquo;re unpacking structures that often hold lots of values (like lists) and structures that often hold a very specific number of values (like tuples) you may decide that your code appears more <em>semantically accurate</em> if you use a list-like syntax when unpacking those list-like structures.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;d like you might even decide to adopt a convention of always using a list-like syntax when unpacking list-like structures (frequently the case when using <code>*</code> in multiple assignment):</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; [first, *rest] = numbers
</code></pre>

<p>I don&rsquo;t usually use this convention myself, mostly because I&rsquo;m just not in the habit of using it.
But if you find it helpful, you might consider using this convention in your own code.</p>

<p>When using multiple assignment in your code, consider when and where a list-like syntax might make your code more descriptive and more clear.
This can sometimes improve readability.</p>

<h2>Don&rsquo;t forget about multiple assignment</h2>

<p>Multiple assignment can improve both the readability of your code and the correctness of your code.
It can make your code <strong>more descriptive</strong> while also making implicit assertions about the <strong>size and shape</strong> of the iterables you&rsquo;re unpacking.</p>

<p>The use for multiple assignment that I often see forgotten is its ability to <strong>replace hard coded indexes</strong>, including <strong>replacing hard coded slices</strong> (using the <code>*</code> syntax).
It&rsquo;s also common to overlook the fact that multiple assignment works <em>deeply</em> and can be used with both a <em>tuple-like</em> syntax and a <em>list-like</em> syntax.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s tricky to recognize and remember all the cases that multiple assignment can come in handy.
