    <updated>2017-01-01T17:00:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://treyhunner.com/2017/01/my-favorite-audiobooks-of-2016</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I set a goal of listening to 40 audiobooks in 2016.  I met that goal, but just barely.  I finished exactly 40 books and one of them I actually read the old fashioned way&hellip; as an e-book!  (Philip Morgan really needs to record an audiobook of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25754062-the-positioning-manual-for-technical-firms">The Positioning Manual</a>.)</p>

<p>I try to listen to a diverse set of books every year: I want to end my year having read books from different categories and genres and from authors with different backgrounds and writing styles.</p>

<p>I wrote about my favorite audiobooks I read in <a href="http://treyhunner.com/2015/12/my-favorite-audiobooks-of-2015/">2015</a> and <a href="http://treyhunner.com/2014/12/top-6-books-of-2014/">2014</a>.  Now I&rsquo;m going to attempt the same thing for 2016.  This task is always difficult because many of these books are very different from each other so I&rsquo;m not comparing apples to apples.  But I&rsquo;m going to try my best to pick my top 6.</p>

<p>The full list of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2016/29459515">books I read in 2016 is available on my Goodreads page</a>.</p>

<h3>1. Success and Luck</h3>

<p>This book was written by an economist, but you don&rsquo;t need to know anything at all about economics to appreciate most of it.  The book is strangely (though conveniently) split into two parts: the first two-thirds of the book are very different from the last one-third.</p>

<p>During the first two-thirds of the book, Robert Frank describes the role of luck in our lives.  I believe the world view he describes can result in increased humility and happiness; it&rsquo;s a mental model of the world which encourages gratitude for your life&rsquo;s path.</p>

<p>The last one-third of the book describes a tax policy that makes quite a bit of sense once you&rsquo;ve embraced this world view.  If not you&rsquo;re into economics, feel free to skim or skip this part.  I found it pretty interesting and quite worthwhile considering it&rsquo;s only one-third of a fairly short book.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m skeptical of meritocracies, self-made people, and the idea that &ldquo;you can make it if you try&rdquo;.  If you do not share this particular brand of skepticism but you&rsquo;re curious about the reasons behind my views, read this book.  It does a great job of coherently expressing certain thoughts I&rsquo;ve had, but never been able to verbalize.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26597345-success-and-luck">Success and Luck</a> by Robert H. Frank</p>

<p><a href="http://www.downpour.com/catalog/product/view/id/221484/">DRM-free audiobook</a> read by the author, Robert H. Frank</p>

<h3>2. Make it Stick</h3>

<p>My biggest career transition so far has been moving from consultant to trainer: as of mid-2015, I teach for a living.  I used to solve business problems that involved writing code, but now I focus on solving business problems that involve teaching others to write code.  I picked up Make it Stick in an effort to improve my teaching style.</p>

<p>This is one of the first books I&rsquo;ve read on pedagogy.  The book covered a lot of ground.  The authors consist of a writer (Peter C. Brown) and two cognitive scientists (Henry L. Roediger III and Mark A. McDaniel).  Together, they&rsquo;ve made a coherent book consisting of actionable advice based in research.  That&rsquo;s the big distinguishing feature of this book: it&rsquo;s research summed up for the masses.</p>

<p>This book covers the growth mindset, active retrieval, interleaved practice, spaced practice, elaboration, and other topics I&rsquo;ve forgotten the names of.  While reading this book, I frequently had ideas about how I could improve my training style.  I plan to reread this book again in 2017 as I actively incorporate ideas from this book into my training courses.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18770267-make-it-stick">Make it Stick</a> by Peter C. Brown, Henry L. Roediger III, Mark A. McDaniel</p>

<p><a href="http://www.downpour.com/catalog/product/view/id/158926/">DRM-free audiobook</a> read by Qarie Marshall</p>

<h3>3. The Brain Audit</h3>

<p>I believe this is the first audiobook I&rsquo;ve listened to twice.  I listened to it early in the year while on a family vacation and then listened to it a few months later while struggling to apply some of the ideas from this book to my business.</p>

<p>This is not just a business book.  I&rsquo;ve found this book valuable when promoting my Python chats, tweeting about charitable and non-profit events, and even writing blog posts.</p>

<p>The Brain Audit really changed the way I look at my business, my writing, and sales &amp; marketing in general.  Most importantly, it included a ton of actionable advice.  Sean D&#8217;Souza does give some general advice but he definitely gets very specific with some of his advice, which I really appreciated.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.psychotactics.com/brain-audit-audio-book/">DRM-free audiobook</a> read by the author, Sean D&#8217;Souza</p>

<h3>4. How to Be Black</h3>

<p>I read this book before realizing that I&rsquo;ve seen Baratunde participating in the CodeNewbies Twitter chats.</p>

<p>I did not know what this book was about when I picked it up and the book started as a satirical instruction manual of sorts which both confused and amused me.  The majority of the book was a memoir punctuated by life lessons and questions answered by a panel of &ldquo;experts&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The book pokes fun at the notion of categorizing people by blackness, but it does so while staying grounded in the reality of our race-aware world.  The asides between Baratunde&rsquo;s story included groan-worthy truths, ideas pushed to ridiculous ends, and a lot of humor wrapped around both light and heavy subjects.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12959743-how-to-be-black">How to Be Black</a> by Baratunde Thurston</p>

<p><a href="http://www.downpour.com/catalog/product/view/id/96254/">DRM-free audiobook</a> read by the author, Baratunde Thurston</p>

<h3>5. The Art of Asking</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m likely biased in my enjoyment for this book by the fact that I like Amanda Palmer&rsquo;s music and I appreciated watching interviews and talks from her before reading her book.</p>

<p>This is not a self help book: this is really more of a themed memoir.  I really enjoyed hearing Amanda Palmer&rsquo;s story and I especially enjoyed hearing her read her own work.  She narrates very well and the occasional musical interludes made the book even more special to me.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20980987-the-art-of-asking-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-let-people-hel">The Art of Asking</a> by Amanda Palmer</p>

<p><a href="http://www.downpour.com/catalog/product/view/id/178890/">DRM-free audiobook</a> read by the author, Amanda Palmer</p>

<h3>6. The Beautiful Struggle</h3>

<p>This is non-fiction, but the scenes stuck with me like it was fiction.  Ta-Nehisi Coates&#8217; told the story of his childhood beautifully.  This was very well-written and the audiobook was well-narrated.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2784926-the-beautiful-struggle">The Beautiful Struggle</a> by Ta-Nehisi Coates</p>

<p><a href="http://www.downpour.com/catalog/product/view/id/224786/">DRM-free audiobook</a> read by J.D. Jackson</p>

<h3>More books</h3>

<p>After compiling this list I realized a few interesting things:</p>

<ul>
<li>All of the books are available DRM-free (this wasn&rsquo;t true for my 2014 and 2015 lists)</li>
<li>Most of the books are narrated by the authors, which is slightly uncommon</li>
<li>All of these books are non-fiction</li>
</ul>


<p>Usually I mix in some fiction, so I&rsquo;ll recommend some of the fiction I read now.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for historical fiction try <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14891.A_Tree_Grows_in_Brooklyn">A Tree Grows in Brooklyn</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/230996.Wild_Ginger">Wild Ginger</a>, or <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18749.Half_of_a_Yellow_Sun">Half of a Yellow Sun</a>.  If you&rsquo;re looking for science fiction or fantasy try <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/115969.Overclocked">Overclocked</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14497.Neverwhere">Neverwhere</a>, or <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9969571-ready-player-one">Ready Player One</a>.</p>

<p>Now for this year&rsquo;s reading goal!  I&rsquo;m going to be a little less ambitious this year.  I plan to listen to more long audiobooks, so I&rsquo;ve lowered my reading goal drastically.  In 2017 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/7102421">I plan to read 24 books</a>, all of them likely audiobooks.  Feel free to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29459515-trey-hunner">follow me on Goodreads</a> if you&rsquo;d like to keep up with my reading habits.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I set a goal of listening to 50 audiobooks in 2015 and I met this goal.  I listened to over 400 hours of audiobooks &ndash; that&rsquo;s over 1 hour of listening per day.</p>

<p>I make an effort to listen to audiobooks that challenge me.  I try to read books by people from different backgrounds, books from genres I&rsquo;m unaccustomed to, and books on subjects that challenge my world views.</p>

<p>This list only represents 10 of my favorite listens from this year.  You can find a <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2015/29459515">full list of the books I read in 2015 on my Goodreads page</a>.</p>

<h3>1. How to Slowly Kill Yourself and Others in America</h3>

<p>This book meanders through heavy issues, including exceptionalism, misogyny, and dying young.  Kanye, Obama, and Tupac all make appearances.  This is some of the most eloquent and addictive prose I&rsquo;ve heard: witty and grave.</p>

</ul>


<h3>2. Whistling Vivaldi</h3>

<p>Even in the seeming absence of individual and institutional discrimination, we can be affected by stereotype threats.  Identity threat is a real problem.  If you help lead an organization of people, you should read this book or at least read a good summary of it.</p>

</ul>


<h3>3. Americanah</h3>

<p>The main character, Ifemelu, is a complex individual who struggles with romance, family, and identity.  I really enjoyed this story and I especially enjoyed Adjoa Andoh&rsquo;s audiobook narration.</p>

</ul>


<h3>4. The Righteous Mind</h3>

<p>We tend to categorize ourselves based on which moral pillars we hold sacred and which we ignore.  It is difficult but important to empathize with those who recognize different moral pillars than you.</p>

</ul>


<h3>5. The New Jim Crow</h3>

<p>This book discusses the effects of the war on drugs, rising incarceration rates, affirmative action, color-blindness, and a number of other issues.  I learned quite a few eye-opening facts while reading.  Take a break from Law and Order and listen to this book instead.</p>

<h3>6. Reading Lolita in Tehran</h3>

<p>In this book we reflect upon Iranian life through nineteenth and twentieth century literature.  Culture and politics are discussed in the context of the books studied in a secret book club.</p>

</ul>


<h3>7. Twelve Years a Slave</h3>

<p>This autobiography was very clear, very event-filled, and overall I found it very well-written.  I had less trouble keeping track of the characters than in much of the fiction I read.  I haven&rsquo;t seen the movie yet, but I&rsquo;m hoping it&rsquo;s as good as the book.</p>

</ul>


<h3>8. The Wordy Shipmates</h3>

<p>This journey through history included religion, politics, and drama with tie-ins to modern culture and a smattering of humor.  I didn&rsquo;t understand much of this book, but I did really enjoy it.</p>

</ul>


<h3>9. The Handmaid&rsquo;s Tale</h3>

<p>Some people call this book &ldquo;science fiction&rdquo;.  I&rsquo;d call it fiction set in the future, a relatable and frightening future.  This dystopian patriarchy is fueled by religious extremism and a fertility problem.</p>

</ul>


<h3>10. For the Win</h3>

<p>This book focuses on abuse of workers around the world.  It doesn&rsquo;t focus on technology or corruption, unlike other Doctorow books I&rsquo;ve read.  The protagonists (there were many) seemed less stereotypical than the protagonist in Little Brother.</p>

    <link href="http://treyhunner.com/2014/12/top-6-books-of-2014/"/>
    <updated>2014-12-20T12:00:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://treyhunner.com/2014/12/top-6-books-of-2014</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I rarely read books.  I tend to lose my place after putting books down for too long and I&rsquo;m generally a slow and easily-distracted reader.</p>

<p>I discovered audiobooks this year and it has reintroduced me to long-form books, both fiction and non-fiction.  I have listened to about one book a week for the last 9 months.</p>

<h2>&ldquo;Just Mercy&rdquo; by Bryan Stevenson</h2>

<h4>Content</h4>

<p>In this book, Bryan Stevenson retells stories about the founding of the Equal Justice Initiative as well as some of the cases he worked on, focusing primarily on the case of Walter McMillian.  This book was engrossing, hope-filled, and crushing at times.  I had given little thought to the inner-workings of our justice system before reading this book.</p>

<h4>Narration</h4>

<p>I really enjoyed Bryan Stevenson&rsquo;s self-narration.  He isn&rsquo;t a particularly animated orator, but he tells a story well and I never caught myself dozing off.</p>

<h4>Links</h4>

<h2>&ldquo;Little Brother&rdquo; by Cory Doctorow</h2>

<h4>Content</h4>

<p>This reads like a modern 1984.  The science fiction was minimal and the reactions of the public and the government felt fairly believable.</p>

<p>This is the first book in the Little Brother trilogy.  I enjoyed the first book the most.  The last book didn&rsquo;t serve much purpose except to wrap up the series.</p>

<h4>Narration</h4>

<p>I enjoyed Kirby Heyborne&rsquo;s narration and character voices.  In comparison, Wil Wheaton&rsquo;s reading of Homeland (book 2 of the trilogy) was animated, but he pronounced some names strangely.  I liked Cory Doctorow&rsquo;s reading of Lawful Interception (book 3) the most out of the three books in the series.</p>

<h2>&ldquo;Lesterland&rdquo; by Lawrence Lessig</h2>

<h4>Content</h4>

<p>Lawrence Lessig explains a core problem in our democratic republic: the way we fund political campaigns.  For a summary of the book, check out his <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lawrence_lessig_we_the_people_and_the_republic_we_must_reclaim">TED talk</a> on the same topic.</p>

<h4>Narration</h4>

<p>I enjoyed Lawrence Lessig&rsquo;s self-narration.  It was like listening to an extended version of his <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lawrence_lessig_we_the_people_and_the_republic_we_must_reclaim">TED talk</a>.</p>

<h4>Links</h4>

<h2>&ldquo;The Martian&rdquo; by Andy Weir</h2>

<h4>Content</h4>

<p>Astronaut Mark Watney struggles to survive on Mars after a dust storm nearly kills him and causes his crew to evacuate after they assume he died.  Watney&rsquo;s ingenuity, luck, and sense of humor made this an enjoyable read.  The science sounded mostly plausible also.</p>

<h4>Narration</h4>

<p>I enjoyed R. C. Brady&rsquo;s narration of Mark Watney&rsquo;s dark humor.</p>

<h4>Links</h4>

<p><a href="http://www.audible.com/pd/Sci-Fi-Fantasy/The-Martian-Audiobook/B00B5HZGUG/">Audible link</a></p>

<h2>&ldquo;A Short History of Nearly Everything&rdquo; by Bill Bryson</h2>

<h4>Content</h4>

<p>This book crams in a lot of facts as well as historical context.  It does meander quite a bit, but I really enjoyed it.</p>

<h4>Narration</h4>

<p>Richard Matthew has a very soothing voice.  I really enjoyed listening to this book while on vacation and while falling asleep.</p>

<p>There is also an abridged version of this book read by the author.  I haven&rsquo;t listened to the abridged version, but I did enjoy the author&rsquo;s reading of &ldquo;At Home&rdquo;.  Bill Bryson reads well, but his voice isn&rsquo;t nearly as soothing as Richard Matthew&rsquo;s.</p>

<h2>&ldquo;You Are Not So Smart&rdquo; by David McRaney</h2>

<h4>Content</h4>

<p>This book is packed with common self-delusions.  Unfortunately, most delusions do not come with solutions attached, but sometimes just knowing about a delusion can help make your world view slightly more realistic.</p>

<h4>Narration</h4>

<p>Don Hagen&rsquo;s narration is fairly dry, but it works well with the tone of the book.</p>

selection of DRM-free audiobooks.  Unfortunately not all audiobooks are
available on either of these sites, so I often end up searching both sites for
each book to discover what versions (if any) are available from each.  I got
sick of searching both websites all the time, so I just created a Python script
to do that work for me.</p>

<h3>Future Improvements</h3>

<p>Some ideas for future improvements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add <a href="http://www.audible.com/">Audible</a> results when the book cannot be found in a DRM-free format</li>
<li>Rewrite the script in JavaScript and create a Chrome extension out of it</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://github.com/kennethreitz/clint">clint</a> to colorize the command-line output</li>
</ul>
