    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are a lot of places you&rsquo;ll see <code>*</code> and <code>**</code> used in Python.
These two operators can be a bit mysterious at times, both for brand new programmers and for folks moving from many other programming languages which may not have completely equivalent operators.
I&rsquo;d like to discuss what those operators are and the many ways they&rsquo;re used.</p>

<p>The <code>*</code> and <code>**</code> operators have grown in ability over the years and I&rsquo;ll be discussing all the ways that you can currently use these operators and noting which uses only work in modern versions of Python.
So if you learned <code>*</code> and <code>**</code> back in the days of Python 2, I&rsquo;d recommend at least skimming this article because Python 3 has added a lot of new uses for these operators.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re newer to Python and you&rsquo;re not yet familiar with keyword arguments (a.k.a. named arguments), I&rsquo;d recommend reading my article on <a href="https://treyhunner.com/2018/04/keyword-arguments-in-python/">keyword arguments in Python</a> first.</p>

<ul data-toc=".entry-content"></ul>


<h2>What we&rsquo;re not talking about</h2>

<p>When I discuss <code>*</code> and <code>**</code> in this article, I&rsquo;m talking about the <code>*</code> and <code>**</code> <em>prefix</em> operators, not the <em>infix</em> operators.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;m not talking about multiplication and exponentiation:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; 2 * 5
10
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2 ** 5
32
</code></pre>

<h2>So what are we talking about?</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;re talking about the <code>*</code> and <code>**</code> prefix operators, that is the <code>*</code> and <code>**</code> operators that are used before a variable.  For example:</p>

<pre><code class="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers = [2, 1, 3, 4, 7]
&gt;&gt;&gt; more_numbers = [*numbers, 11, 18]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(*more_numbers, sep=', ')
2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18
</code></pre>

<p>Two of the uses of <code>*</code> are shown in that code and no uses of <code>**</code> are shown.</p>

<p>This includes:</p>

<ol>
<li>Using <code>*</code> and <code>**</code> to pass arguments to a function</li>
<li>Using <code>*</code> and <code>**</code> to capture arguments passed into a function</li>
<li>Using <code>*</code> to accept keyword-only arguments</li>
<li>Using <code>*</code> to capture items during tuple unpacking</li>
<li>Using <code>*</code> to unpack iterables into a list/tuple</li>
<li>Using <code>**</code> to unpack dictionaries into other dictionaries</li>
</ol>


<p>Even if you think you&rsquo;re familiar with all of these ways of using <code>*</code> and <code>**</code>, I recommend looking at each of the code blocks below to make sure they&rsquo;re all things you&rsquo;re familiar with.
The Python core developers have continued to add new abilities to these operators over the last few years and it&rsquo;s easy to overlook some of the newer uses of <code>*</code> and <code>**</code>.</p>

<h2>Asterisks for unpacking into function call</h2>

<p>When calling a function, the <code>*</code> operator can be used to unpack an iterable into the arguments in the function call:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; fruits = ['lemon', 'pear', 'watermelon', 'tomato']
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(fruits[0], fruits[1], fruits[2], fruits[3])
lemon pear watermelon tomato
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(*fruits)
lemon pear watermelon tomato
</code></pre>

<p>That <code>print(*fruits)</code> line is passing all of the items in the <code>fruits</code> list into the <code>print</code> function call as separate arguments, without us even needing to know how many arguments are in the list.</p>

<p>The <code>*</code> operator isn&rsquo;t just syntactic sugar here.
This ability of sending in all items in a particular iterable as separate arguments wouldn&rsquo;t be possible without <code>*</code>, unless the list was a fixed length.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s another example:</p>

<pre><code class="python">def transpose_list(list_of_lists):
    return [
        list(row)
        for row in zip(*list_of_lists)
    ]
</code></pre>

<p>Here we&rsquo;re accepting a list of lists and returning a &ldquo;transposed&rdquo; list of lists.</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; transpose_list([[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9]])
[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>**</code> operator does something similar, but with keyword arguments.
The <code>**</code> operator allows us to take a dictionary of key-value pairs and unpack it into keyword arguments in a function call.</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; date_info = {'year': "2020", 'month': "01", 'day': "01"}
&gt;&gt;&gt; filename = "{year}-{month}-{day}.txt".format(**date_info)
&gt;&gt;&gt; filename
'2020-01-01.txt'
</code></pre>

<p>From my experience, using <code>**</code> to unpack keyword arguments into a function call isn&rsquo;t particularly common.
The place I see this most is when practicing inheritance: calls to <code>super()</code> often include both <code>*</code> and <code>**</code>.</p>

<p>Both <code>*</code> and <code>**</code> can be used multiple times in function calls, as of Python 3.5.</p>

<p>Using <code>*</code> multiple times can sometimes be handy:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; fruits = ['lemon', 'pear', 'watermelon', 'tomato']
&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers = [2, 1, 3, 4, 7]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(*numbers, *fruits)
2 1 3 4 7 lemon pear watermelon tomato
</code></pre>

<p>Using <code>**</code> multiple times looks similar:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; date_info = {'year': "2020", 'month': "01", 'day': "01"}
&gt;&gt;&gt; track_info = {'artist': "Beethoven", 'title': 'Symphony No 5'}
&gt;&gt;&gt; filename = "{year}-{month}-{day}-{artist}-{title}.txt".format(
...     **date_info,
...     **track_info,
... )
&gt;&gt;&gt; filename
'2020-01-01-Beethoven-Symphony No 5.txt'
</code></pre>

<p>You need to be careful when using <code>**</code> multiple times though.
Functions in Python can&rsquo;t have the same keyword argument specified multiple times, so the keys in each dictionary used with <code>**</code> must be distinct or an exception will be raised.</p>

<h2>Asterisks for packing arguments given to function</h2>

<p>When defining a function, the <code>*</code> operator can be used to capture an unlimited number of positional arguments given to the function.
These arguments are captured into a tuple.</p>

<pre><code class="python">from random import randint

def roll(*dice):
    return sum(randint(1, die) for die in dice)
</code></pre>

<p>This function accepts any number of arguments:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; roll(20)
18
&gt;&gt;&gt; roll(6, 6)
9
&gt;&gt;&gt; roll(6, 6, 6)
8
</code></pre>

<p>Python&rsquo;s <code>print</code> and <code>zip</code> functions accept any number of positional arguments.
This argument-packing use of <code>*</code> allows us to make our own function which, like <code>print</code> and <code>zip</code>, accept any number of arguments.</p>

<p>The <code>**</code> operator also has another side to it: we can use <code>**</code> when defining a function to capture any keyword arguments given to the function into a dictionary:</p>

<pre><code class="python">def tag(tag_name, **attributes):
    attribute_list = [
        f'{name}="{value}"'
        for name, value in attributes.items()
    ]
    return f"&lt;{tag_name} {' '.join(attribute_list)}&gt;"
</code></pre>

<p>That <code>**</code> will capture any keyword arguments we give to this function into a dictionary which will that <code>attributes</code> arguments will reference.</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; tag('a', href="http://treyhunner.com")
'&lt;a href="http://treyhunner.com"&gt;'
&gt;&gt;&gt; tag('img', height=20, width=40, src="face.jpg")
'&lt;img height="20" width="40" src="face.jpg"&gt;'
</code></pre>

<h2>Positional arguments with keyword-only arguments</h2>

<p>As of Python 3, we now have a special syntax for accepting keyword-only arguments to functions.
Keyword-only arguments are function arguments which can <em>only</em> be specified using the keyword syntax, meaning they cannot be specified positionally.</p>

<p>To accept keyword-only arguments, we can put named arguments after a <code>*</code> usage when defining our function:</p>

<pre><code class="python">def get_multiple(*keys, dictionary, default=None):
    return [
        dictionary.get(key, default)
        for key in keys
    ]
</code></pre>

<p>The above function can be used like this:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; fruits = {'lemon': 'yellow', 'orange': 'orange', 'tomato': 'red'}
&gt;&gt;&gt; get_multiple('lemon', 'tomato', 'squash', dictionary=fruits, default='unknown')
['yellow', 'red', 'unknown']
</code></pre>

<p>The arguments <code>dictionary</code> and <code>default</code> come after <code>*keys</code>, which means they can <em>only</em> be specified as <a href="https://treyhunner.com/2018/04/keyword-arguments-in-python/">keyword arguments</a>.
If we try to specify them positionally we&rsquo;ll get an error:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; fruits = {'lemon': 'yellow', 'orange': 'orange', 'tomato': 'red'}
&gt;&gt;&gt; get_multiple('lemon', 'tomato', 'squash', fruits, 'unknown')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: get_multiple() missing 1 required keyword-only argument: 'dictionary'
</code></pre>

<p>This behavior was introduced to Python through <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3102/">PEP 3102</a>.</p>

<h2>Keyword-only arguments without positional arguments</h2>

<p>That keyword-only argument feature is cool, but what if you want to require keyword-only arguments without capturing unlimited positional arguments?</p>

<p>Python allows this with a somewhat strange <code>*</code>-on-its-own syntax:</p>

<pre><code class="python">def with_previous(iterable, *, fillvalue=None):
    """Yield each iterable item along with the item before it."""
    previous = fillvalue
    for item in iterable:
        yield previous, item
        previous = item
</code></pre>

<p>This function accepts an <code>iterable</code> argument, which can be specified positionally (as the first argument) or by its name and a <code>fillvalue</code> argument which is a keyword-only argument.  This means we can call <code>with_previous</code> like this:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; list(with_previous([2, 1, 3], fillvalue=0))
[(0, 2), (2, 1), (1, 3)]
</code></pre>

<p>But not like this:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; list(with_previous([2, 1, 3], 0))
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: with_previous() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given
</code></pre>

<p>This function accepts two arguments and one of them, <code>fillvalue</code> <em>must be specified as a keyword argument</em>.</p>

<p>I usually use keyword-only arguments used while capturing any number of positional arguments, but I do sometimes use this <code>*</code> to enforce an argument to only be specified positionally.</p>

<p>Python&rsquo;s built-in <code>sorted</code> function actually uses this approach.  If you look at the help information on <code>sorted</code> you&rsquo;ll see the following:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; help(sorted)
Help on built-in function sorted in module builtins:

sorted(iterable, /, *, key=None, reverse=False)
    Return a new list containing all items from the iterable in ascending order.

    A custom key function can be supplied to customize the sort order, and the
    reverse flag can be set to request the result in descending order.
</code></pre>

<p>There&rsquo;s an <code>*</code>-on-its-own, right in the documented arguments for <code>sorted</code>.</p>

<h2>Asterisks in tuple unpacking</h2>

<p>Python 3 also added a new way of using the <code>*</code> operator that is only somewhat related to the <code>*</code>-when-defining-a-function and <code>*</code>-when-calling-a-function features above.</p>

<p>The <code>*</code> operator can also be used in tuple unpacking now:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; fruits = ['lemon', 'pear', 'watermelon', 'tomato']
&gt;&gt;&gt; first, second, *remaining = fruits
&gt;&gt;&gt; remaining
['watermelon', 'tomato']
&gt;&gt;&gt; first, *remaining = fruits
&gt;&gt;&gt; remaining
['pear', 'watermelon', 'tomato']
&gt;&gt;&gt; first, *middle, last = fruits
&gt;&gt;&gt; middle
['pear', 'watermelon']
</code></pre>

<p>If you&rsquo;re wondering &ldquo;where could I use this in my own code&rdquo;, take a look at the examples in my article on <a href="https://treyhunner.com/2018/03/tuple-unpacking-improves-python-code-readability/">tuple unpacking in Python</a>.
In that article I show how this use of the <code>*</code> operator can sometimes be used as an alternative to sequence slicing.</p>

<p>Usually when I teach <code>*</code> I note that you can only use one <code>*</code> expression in a single multiple assignment call.
That&rsquo;s technically incorrect because it&rsquo;s possible to use two in a nested unpacking (I talk about nested unpacking in my tuple unpacking article):</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; fruits = ['lemon', 'pear', 'watermelon', 'tomato']
&gt;&gt;&gt; ((first_letter, *remaining), *other_fruits) = fruits
&gt;&gt;&gt; remaining
['e', 'm', 'o', 'n']
&gt;&gt;&gt; other_fruits
['pear', 'watermelon', 'tomato']
</code></pre>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen a good use for this though and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d recommend using it even if you found one because it seems a bit cryptic.</p>

<p>The PEP that added this to Python 3.0 is <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3132/">PEP 3132</a> and it&rsquo;s not a very long one.</p>

<h2>Asterisks in list literals</h2>

<p>Python 3.5 introduced a ton of new <code>*</code>-related features through <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0448/">PEP 448</a>.
One of the biggest new features is the ability to use <code>*</code> to dump an iterable into a new list.</p>

<p>Say you have a function that takes any sequence and returns a list with the sequence and the reverse of that sequence concatenated together:</p>

<pre><code class="python">def palindromify(sequence):
    return list(sequence) + list(reversed(sequence))
</code></pre>

<p>This function needs to convert things to lists a couple times in order to concatenate the lists and return the result.
In Python 3.5, we can type this instead:</p>

<pre><code class="python">def palindromify(sequence):
    return [*sequence, *reversed(sequence)]
</code></pre>

<p>This code removes some needless list calls so our code is both more efficient and more readable.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s another example:</p>

<pre><code class="python">def rotate_first_item(sequence):
    return [*sequence[1:], sequence[0]]
</code></pre>

<p>That function returns a new list where the first item in the given list (or other sequence) is moved to the end of the new list.</p>

<p>This use of the <code>*</code> operator is a great way to concatenate iterables of different types together.
The <code>*</code> operator works for any iterable, whereas using the <code>+</code> operator only works on particular sequences which have to all be the same type.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t just limited to creating lists either.
We can also dump iterables into new tuples or sets:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; fruits = ['lemon', 'pear', 'watermelon', 'tomato']
&gt;&gt;&gt; (*fruits[1:], fruits[0])
('pear', 'watermelon', 'tomato', 'lemon')
&gt;&gt;&gt; uppercase_fruits = (f.upper() for f in fruits)
&gt;&gt;&gt; {*fruits, *uppercase_fruits}
{'lemon', 'watermelon', 'TOMATO', 'LEMON', 'PEAR', 'WATERMELON', 'tomato', 'pear'}
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that the last line above takes a list and a generator and dumps them into a new set.
Before this use of <code>*</code>, there wasn&rsquo;t previously an easy way to do this in one line of code.
There was a way to do this before, but it wasn&rsquo;t easy to remember or discover:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; set().union(fruits, uppercase_fruits)
{'lemon', 'watermelon', 'TOMATO', 'LEMON', 'PEAR', 'WATERMELON', 'tomato', 'pear'}
</code></pre>

<h2>Double asterisks in dictionary literals</h2>

<p>PEP 448 also expanded the abilities of <code>**</code> by allowing this operator to be used for dumping key/value pairs from one dictionary into a new dictionary:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; date_info = {'year': "2020", 'month': "01", 'day': "01"}
&gt;&gt;&gt; track_info = {'artist': "Beethoven", 'title': 'Symphony No 5'}
&gt;&gt;&gt; all_info = {**date_info, **track_info}
&gt;&gt;&gt; all_info
{'year': '2020', 'month': '01', 'day': '01', 'artist': 'Beethoven', 'title': 'Symphony No 5'}
</code></pre>

<p>I wrote another article on how this is now the <a href="https://treyhunner.com/2016/02/how-to-merge-dictionaries-in-python/">idiomatic way to merge dictionaries in Python</a>.</p>

<p>This can be used for more than just merging two dictionaries together though.</p>

<p>For example we can copy a dictionary while adding a new value to it:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; date_info = {'year': '2020', 'month': '01', 'day': '7'}
&gt;&gt;&gt; event_info = {**date_info, 'group': "Python Meetup"}
&gt;&gt;&gt; event_info
{'year': '2020', 'month': '01', 'day': '7', 'group': 'Python Meetup'}
</code></pre>

<p>Or copy/merge dictionaries while overriding particular values:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; event_info = {'year': '2020', 'month': '01', 'day': '7', 'group': 'Python Meetup'}
&gt;&gt;&gt; new_info = {**event_info, 'day': "14"}
&gt;&gt;&gt; new_info
{'year': '2020', 'month': '01', 'day': '14', 'group': 'Python Meetup'}
</code></pre>

<h2>Python&rsquo;s asterisks are powerful</h2>

<p>Python&rsquo;s <code>*</code> and <code>**</code> operators aren&rsquo;t just syntactic sugar.
Some of the things they allow you to do could be achieved through other means, but the alternatives to <code>*</code> and <code>**</code> tend to be more cumbersome and more resource intensive.
And some of the features they provide are simply impossible to achieve without them: for example there&rsquo;s no way to accept any number of positional arguments to a function without <code>*</code>.</p>

<p>After reading about all the features of <code>*</code> and <code>**</code>, you might be wondering what the names for these odd operators are.
Unfortunately, they don&rsquo;t really have succinct names.
I&rsquo;ve heard <code>*</code> called the &ldquo;packing&rdquo; and &ldquo;unpacking&rdquo; operator.
I&rsquo;ve also heard it called &ldquo;splat&rdquo; (from the Ruby world) and I&rsquo;ve heard it called simply &ldquo;star&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I tend to call these operators &ldquo;star&rdquo; and &ldquo;double star&rdquo; or &ldquo;star star&rdquo;.
That doesn&rsquo;t distinguish them from their infix relatives (multiplication and exponentiation), but context usually makes it obvious whether we&rsquo;re talking about prefix or infix operators.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t understand <code>*</code> and <code>**</code> or you&rsquo;re concerned about memorizing all of their uses, don&rsquo;t be!
These operators have many uses and memorizing the specific use of each one isn&rsquo;t as important as getting a feel for when you might be able to reach for these operators.
I suggest using this article as <strong>a cheat sheet</strong> or to making your own cheat sheet to help you use <code>*</code> and <code>**</code> in Python.</p>

<h2>Practice makes perfect</h2>

<p>You don&rsquo;t learn by putting information in your head, you learn by attempting to retrieve information from your head.
So you&rsquo;ve just read an article on something new, but <strong>you haven&rsquo;t learned yet</strong>.</p>

<p>I highly recommend you write some code that you uses <code>*</code> and <code>**</code> in a number of different ways today and then quiz yourself on the different ways to use these operators tomorrow.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d love to send you an exercise on to get some practice with <code>*</code> and <code>**</code> right now.

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Overusing lambda expressions in Python]]></title>
    <link href="https://treyhunner.com/2018/09/stop-writing-lambda-expressions/"/>
    <updated>2018-09-27T07:30:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>https://treyhunner.com/2018/09/stop-writing-lambda-expressions</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Note</strong>: This post was originally titled &ldquo;Stop writing lambda expressions in Python&rdquo; but I&rsquo;ve changed the title after deciding that it was a little too extreme.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard for me to teach an in-depth Python class without discussing lambda expressions.
I almost always get questions about them.
My students tend to see them in code on StackOverflow or they see them in a coworker&rsquo;s code (which, realistically, may have also come from StackOverflow).</p>

<p>I get a lot of questions about lambda, I&rsquo;m hesitant to recommend my students embrace Python&rsquo;s lambda expressions.
I have had an aversion to lambda expressions for many years, and since I started teaching Python more regularly a few years ago, my aversion to lambda expressions has only grown stronger.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to explain how I see lambda expressions and why I tend to recommend my students avoid using them.</p>

<h2>Lambda expressions in Python: what are they?</h2>

<p>Lambda expressions a special syntax in Python for creating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function">anonymous functions</a>.
I&rsquo;ll call the <code>lambda</code> syntax itself a <strong>lambda expression</strong> and the function you get back from this I&rsquo;ll call a <strong>lambda function</strong>.</p>

<p>Python&rsquo;s lambda expressions allow a function to be created and passed around (often into another function) all in one line of code.</p>

<p>Lambda expressions allow us to take this code:</p>

<pre><code class="python">colors = ["Goldenrod", "Purple", "Salmon", "Turquoise", "Cyan"])

def normalize_case(string):
    return string.casefold()

normalized_colors = map(normalize_case, colors)
</code></pre>

<p>And turn it into this code:</p>

<pre><code class="python">colors = ["Goldenrod", "Purple", "Salmon", "Turquoise", "Cyan"])

normalized_colors = map(lambda s: s.casefold(), colors)
</code></pre>

<p>Lambda expressions are just a special syntax for making functions.
They can only have one statement in them and they return the result of that statement automatically.</p>

<p>The inherent limitations of lambda expressions are actually part of their appeal.
When an experienced Python programmer sees a lambda expression they know that they&rsquo;re working with a function that is <strong>only used in one place</strong> and does <strong>just one thing</strong>.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever used anonymous functions in JavaScript before, you can think of Python&rsquo;s lambda expressions as the same, except they have more restrictions and use a very different syntax than the traditional function syntax.</p>

<h2>Where they&rsquo;re usually used</h2>

<p>You&rsquo;ll typically see <code>lambda</code> expressions used when calling functions (or classes) that accept a function as an argument.</p>

<p>Python&rsquo;s built-in <code>sorted</code> function accepts a function as its <code>key</code> argument.  This <em>key function</em> is used to compute a comparison key when determining the sorting order of items.</p>

<p>So <code>sorted</code> is a great example of a place that lambda expressions are often used:</p>

<pre><code class="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; colors = ["Goldenrod", "purple", "Salmon", "turquoise", "cyan"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; sorted(colors, key=lambda s: s.casefold())
['cyan', 'Goldenrod', 'purple', 'Salmon', 'turquoise']
</code></pre>

<p>The above code returns the given colors sorted in a case-insensitive way.</p>

<p>The <code>sorted</code> function isn&rsquo;t the only use of lambda expressions, but it&rsquo;s a common one.</p>

<h2>The pros and cons of lambda</h2>

<p>I frame my thinking around lambda expressions as a constant comparison to using <code>def</code> to define functions.
Both of these tools give us functions, but they each have different limitations and use a different syntax.</p>

<p>The main ways lambda expressions are different from <code>def</code>:</p>

<ol>
<li>They can be immediately passed around (no variable needed)</li>
<li>They can only have a single line of code within them</li>
<li>They return automatically</li>
<li>They can&rsquo;t have a docstring and they don&rsquo;t have a name</li>
<li>They use a different and unfamiliar syntax</li>
</ol>


<p>The fact that lambda expressions can be passed around is their biggest benefit.  Returning automatically is neat but not a big benefit in my mind.  I find the &ldquo;single line of code&rdquo; limitation is neither good nor bad overall.  The fact that lambda functions can&rsquo;t have docstrings and don&rsquo;t have a name is unfortunate and their unfamiliar syntax can be troublesome for newer Pythonistas.</p>

<p>Overall I feel the cons slightly outweigh the pros of lambda expressions, but my biggest complaint about them is that I find that they tend to be both misused and overused.</p>

<h2>Lambda is both misused and overused</h2>

<p>When I see a lambda expression in unfamiliar code I immediately become skeptical.
When I encounter a lambda expression in the wild, I often find that removing it improves code readability.</p>

<p>Sometimes the issue is that lambda expressions are being misused, meaning they&rsquo;re <strong>used in a way that is nearly always unideal</strong>.
Other times lambda expressions are simply being overused, meaning they&rsquo;re acceptable but I&rsquo;d personally <strong>prefer to see the code written a different way</strong>.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at the various ways lambda expressions are misused and overused.</p>

<h2>Misuse: naming lambda expressions</h2>

<p>PEP8, the official Python style guide, advises never to write code like this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">normalize_case = lambda s: s.casefold()
</code></pre>

<p>The above statement makes an anonymous function and then assigns it to a variable.
The above code ignores the reason lambda functions are useful: <strong>lambda functions can be passed around without needing to be assigned to a variable first</strong>.</p>

<p>If you want to create a one-liner function and store it in a variable, you should use <code>def</code> instead:</p>

<pre><code class="python">def normalize_case(s): return s.casefold()
</code></pre>

<p>PEP8 recommends this because named functions are a common and easily understood thing.
This also has the benefit of giving our function a proper name, which could make debugging easier.
Unlike functions defined with <code>def</code>, lambda functions never have a name (it&rsquo;s always <code>&lt;lambda&gt;</code>):</p>

<pre><code class="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; normalize_case = lambda s: s.casefold()
&gt;&gt;&gt; normalize_case
&lt;function &lt;lambda&gt; at 0x7f264d5b91e0&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; def normalize_case(s): return s.casefold()
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; normalize_case
&lt;function normalize_case at 0x7f247f68fea0&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>If you want to create a function and store it in a variable, define your function using <code>def</code></strong>.
That&rsquo;s exactly what it&rsquo;s for.
It doesn&rsquo;t matter if your function is a single line of code or if you&rsquo;re defining a function inside of another function, <code>def</code> works just fine for those use cases.</p>

<h2>Misuse: needless function calls</h2>

<p>I frequently see lambda expressions used to wrap around a function that was already appropriate for the problem at hand.</p>

<p>For example take this code:</p>

<pre><code class="python">sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers, key=lambda n: abs(n))
</code></pre>

<p>The person who wrote this code likely learned that lambda expressions are used for making a function that can be passed around.
But they missed out on a slightly bigger picture idea: <strong>all functions in Python (not just lambda functions) can be passed around</strong>.</p>

<p>Since <code>abs</code> (which returns the absolute value of a number) is a function and all functions can be passed around, we could actually have written the above code like this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers, key=abs)
</code></pre>

<p>Now this example might feel contrived, but it&rsquo;s not terribly uncommon to overuse lambda expressions in this way.  Here&rsquo;s another example I&rsquo;ve seen:</p>

<pre><code class="python">pairs = [(4, 11), (8, 8), (5, 7), (11, 3)]
sorted_by_smallest = sorted(pairs, key=lambda items: min(items))
</code></pre>

<p>Because we&rsquo;re accepting exactly the same arguments as we&rsquo;re passing into <code>min</code>, we don&rsquo;t need that extra function call.  We can just pass the <code>min</code> function to <code>key</code> instead:</p>

<pre><code class="python">pairs = [(4, 11), (8, 8), (5, 7), (11, 3)]
sorted_by_smallest = sorted(pairs, key=min)
</code></pre>

<p>You don&rsquo;t need a lambda function if you already have another function that does what you want.</p>

<h2>Overuse: simple, but non-trivial functions</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s common to see lambda expressions used to make a function that returns a couple of values in a tuple:</p>

<pre><code class="python">colors = ["Goldenrod", "Purple", "Salmon", "Turquoise", "Cyan"])
colors_by_length = sorted(colors, key=lambda c: (len(c), c.casefold()))
</code></pre>

<p>That <code>key</code> function here is helping us sort these colors by their length followed by their case-normalized name.</p>

<p>This code is the same as the above code, but I find it more readable:</p>

<pre><code class="python">def length_and_alphabetical(string):
    """Return sort key: length first, then case-normalized string."""
    return (len(string), string.casefold())

colors = ["Goldenrod", "Purple", "Salmon", "Turquoise", "Cyan"])
colors_by_length = sorted(colors, key=length_and_alphabetical)
</code></pre>

<p>This code is quite a bit more verbose, but I find the name of that key function makes it clearer what we&rsquo;re sorting by.
We&rsquo;re not just sorting by the length and we&rsquo;re not just sorting by the color: we&rsquo;re sorting by both.</p>

<p><strong>If a function is important, it deserves a name</strong>.
You could argue that most functions that are used in a lambda expression are so trivial that they don&rsquo;t deserve a name, but there&rsquo;s often little downside to naming functions and I find it usually makes my code more readable overall.</p>

<p>Naming functions often makes code more readable, the same way <a href="http://treyhunner.com/2018/03/tuple-unpacking-improves-python-code-readability/">using tuple unpacking to name variables</a> instead of using arbitrary index-lookups often makes code more readable.</p>

<h2>Overuse: when multiple lines would help</h2>

<p>Sometimes the &ldquo;just one line&rdquo; aspect of lambda expressions cause us to write code in convoluted ways.  For example take this code:</p>

<pre><code class="python">points = [((1, 2), 'red'), ((3, 4), 'green')]
points_by_color = sorted(points, key=lambda p: p[1])
</code></pre>

<p>We&rsquo;re hard-coding an index lookup here to sort points by their color.
If we used a named function we could have used <a href="http://treyhunner.com/2018/03/tuple-unpacking-improves-python-code-readability/">tuple unpacking</a> to make this code more readable:</p>

<pre><code class="python">def color_of_point(point):
    """Return the color of the given point."""
    (x, y), color = point
    return color

points = [((1, 2), 'red'), ((3, 4), 'green')]
points_by_color = sorted(points, key=color_of_point)
</code></pre>

<p>Tuple unpacking can improve readability over using hard-coded index lookups.
<strong>Using lambda expressions often means sacrificing some Python language features</strong>, specifically those that require multiple lines of code (like an extra assignment statement).</p>

<h2>Overuse: lambda with map and filter</h2>

<p>Python&rsquo;s map and filter functions are almost always paired with lambda expressions.  It&rsquo;s common to see StackOverflow questions asking &ldquo;what is lambda&rdquo; answered with code examples like this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers = [2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18]
&gt;&gt;&gt; squared_numbers = map(lambda n: n**2, numbers)
&gt;&gt;&gt; odd_numbers = filter(lambda n: n % 2 == 1, numbers)
</code></pre>

<p>I find these examples a bit confusing because <strong>I almost never use map and filter in my code</strong>.</p>

<p>Python&rsquo;s <code>map</code> and <code>filter</code> functions are used for looping over an iterable and making a new iterable that either slightly changes each element or filters the iterable down to only elements that match a certain condition.
We can accomplish both of those tasks just as well with list comprehensions or generator expressions:</p>

<pre><code class="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers = [2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18]
&gt;&gt;&gt; squared_numbers = (n**2 for n in numbers)
&gt;&gt;&gt; odd_numbers = (n for n in numbers if n % 2 == 1)
</code></pre>

<p>Personally, I&rsquo;d prefer to see the above generator expressions written over multiple lines of code (<a href="http://treyhunner.com/2015/12/python-list-comprehensions-now-in-color/">see my article on comprehensions</a>) but I find even these one-line generator expressions more readable than those <code>map</code> and <code>filter</code> calls.</p>

<p>The general operations of mapping and filtering are useful, but we really don&rsquo;t need the <code>map</code> and <code>filter</code> functions themselves.
Generator expressions are a special syntax that exists just for the tasks of mapping and filtering.
So my advice is to <strong>use generator expressions instead of the <code>map</code> and <code>filter</code> functions</strong>.</p>

<h2>Misuse: sometimes you don&rsquo;t even need to pass a function</h2>

<p>What about cases where you need to pass around a function that performs a single operation?</p>

<p>Newer Pythonistas who are keen on functional programming sometimes write code like this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">from functools import reduce

numbers = [2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18]
total = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, numbers)
</code></pre>

<p>This code adds all the numbers in the <code>numbers</code> list.
There&rsquo;s an even better way to do this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">numbers = [2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18]
total = sum(numbers)
</code></pre>

<p>Python&rsquo;s built-in <code>sum</code> function was made just for this task.</p>

<p>The <code>sum</code> function, along with a number of other specialized Python tools, are easy to overlook.
But I&rsquo;d encourage you to seek out the more specialized tools when you need them because they often make for more readable code.</p>

<p>Instead of passing functions into other functions, <strong>look into whether there is a more specialized way to solve your problem instead</strong>.</p>

<h2>Overuse: using lambda for very simple operations</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say instead of adding numbers up, we&rsquo;re multiply numbers together:</p>

<pre><code class="python">from functools import reduce

numbers = [2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18]
product = reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, numbers, 1)
</code></pre>

<p>The above lambda expression is necessary because we&rsquo;re not allowed to pass the <code>*</code> operator around as if it were a function.
If there was a function that was equivalent to <code>*</code>, we could pass it into the <code>reduce</code> function instead.</p>

<p>Python&rsquo;s standard library actually has a whole module meant to address this problem:</p>

<pre><code class="python">from functools import reduce
from operator import mul

numbers = [2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18]
product = reduce(mul, numbers, 1)
</code></pre>

<p>Python&rsquo;s <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html">operator module</a> exists to make various Python operators easy to use as functions.
If you&rsquo;re practicing functional(ish) programming, <strong>Python&rsquo;s <code>operator</code> module is your friend</strong>.</p>

<p>In addition to providing functions corresponding to Python&rsquo;s many operators, the <code>operator</code> module provides a couple common higher level functions for accessing items and attributes and calling methods.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s <code>itemgetter</code> for accessing indexes of a list/sequence or keys of a dictionary/mapping:</p>

<pre><code class="python"># Without operator: accessing a key/index
rows_sorted_by_city = sorted(rows, key=lambda row: row['city'])

# With operator: accessing a key/index
from operator import itemgetter
rows_sorted_by_city = sorted(rows, key=itemgetter('city'))
</code></pre>

<p>There&rsquo;s also <code>attrgetter</code> for accessing attributes on an object:</p>

<pre><code class="python"># Without operator: accessing an attribute
products_by_quantity = sorted(products, key=lambda p: p.quantity)

# With operator: accessing an attribute
from operator import attrgetter
products_by_quantity = sorted(products, key=attrgetter('quantity'))
</code></pre>

<p>And <code>methodcaller</code> for calling methods on an object:</p>

<pre><code class="python"># Without operator: calling a method
sorted_colors = sorted(colors, key=lambda s: s.casefold())

# With operator: calling a method
from operator import methodcaller
sorted_colors = sorted(colors, key=methodcaller('casefold'))
</code></pre>

<p>I <em>usually</em> find that <strong>using the functions in the <code>operator</code> module makes my code clearer</strong> than if I&rsquo;d used an equivalent lambda expression.</p>

<h2>Overuse: when higher order functions add confusion</h2>

<p>A function that accepts a function as an argument is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function">higher order function</a>.  Higher order functions are the kinds of functions that we tend to pass lambda functions to.</p>

<p>The use of higher order functions is common when practicing functional programming.  Functional programming isn&rsquo;t the only way to use Python though: Python is a multi-paradigm language so we can mix and match coding disciplines to make our code more readable.</p>

<p>Compare this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">from functools import reduce

numbers = [2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18]
product = reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, numbers, 1)
</code></pre>

<p>To this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">def multiply_all(numbers):
    """Return the product of the given numbers."""
    product = 1
    for n in numbers:
        product *= n
    return product

numbers = [2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18]
product = multiply_all(numbers)
</code></pre>

<p>The second code is longer, but folks without a functional programming background will often find it easier to understand.</p>

<p>Anyone who has gone through one of my Python training courses can probably understand what that <code>multiply_all</code> function does, whereas that <code>reduce</code>/<code>lambda</code> combination is likely a bit more cryptic for many Python programmers.</p>

<p>In general, <strong>passing one function into another function, tends to make code more complex, which can hurt readability</strong>.</p>

<h2>Should you ever use lambda expressions?</h2>

<p>So I find the use of lambda expressions problematic because:</p>

<ul>
<li>lambda expressions are an odd and unfamiliar syntax to many Python programmers</li>
<li>lambda functions inherently lack a name or documentation, meaning reading their code is the only way to figure out what they do</li>
<li>lambda expressions can have only one statement in them so certain language features that improve readability, like tuple unpacking, can&rsquo;t be used with them</li>
<li>lambda functions can often be replaced with already existing functions in the standard libray or built-in to Python</li>
</ul>


<p>Lambda expressions are rarely more immediately readable than a well-named function.
While a <code>def</code> statement is often more understandable, <strong>Python also has a number of features that can be used to replace lambda expressions</strong>, including special syntaxes (comprehensions), built-in functions (sum), and standard library functions (in the <code>operators</code> module).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d say that using lambda expressions is acceptable only if your situation meets all four of these criteria:</p>

<ol>
<li>The operation you&rsquo;re doing is trivial: the function doesn&rsquo;t deserve a name</li>
<li>Having a lambda expression makes your code more understandable than the function names you can think of</li>
<li>You&rsquo;re pretty sure there&rsquo;s not already a function that does what you&rsquo;re looking for</li>
<li>Everyone on your team understands lambda expressions and you&rsquo;ve all agreed to use them</li>
</ol>


<p>If any of those four statements don&rsquo;t fit your situation, I&rsquo;d recommend <strong>writing a new function using <code>def</code></strong> and (whenever possible) <strong>embracing a function that already exists within Python</strong> that already does what you&rsquo;re looking for.</p>

    <id>https://treyhunner.com/2018/06/how-to-make-an-iterator-in-python</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I wrote an article sometime ago on <a href="http://treyhunner.com/2016/12/python-iterator-protocol-how-for-loops-work/">the iterator protocol that powers Python&rsquo;s <code>for</code> loops</a>.
One thing I left out of that article was <strong>how to make your own iterators</strong>.</p>

<p>In this article I&rsquo;m going to discuss why you&rsquo;d want to make your own iterators and then show you how to do so.</p>

<ul data-toc=".entry-content"></ul>


<h2>What is an iterator?</h2>

<p>First let&rsquo;s quickly address what an iterator is.
For a much more detailed explanation, consider watching my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2PkkMS2Ack">Loop Better talk</a> or reading <a href="https://opensource.com/article/18/3/loop-better-deeper-look-iteration-python">the article based on the talk</a>.</p>

<p>An <strong>iter<em>able</em></strong> is anything you&rsquo;re able to loop over.</p>

<p>An <strong>iter<em>ator</em></strong> is the object that does the actual iterating.</p>

<p>You can get an iterator from any iterable by calling the built-in <code>iter</code> function on the iterable.</p>

<pre><code class="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; favorite_numbers = [6, 57, 4, 7, 68, 95]
&gt;&gt;&gt; iter(favorite_numbers)
&lt;list_iterator object at 0x7fe8e5623160&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You can use the built-in <code>next</code> function on an iterator to get the next item from it (you&rsquo;ll get a <code>StopIteration</code> exception if there are no more items).</p>

<pre><code class="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; favorite_numbers = [6, 57, 4, 7, 68, 95]
&gt;&gt;&gt; my_iterator = iter(favorite_numbers)
&gt;&gt;&gt; next(my_iterator)
6
&gt;&gt;&gt; next(my_iterator)
57
</code></pre>

<p>There&rsquo;s one more rule about iterators that makes everything interesting: <strong>iterators are also iterables</strong> and their iterator is themselves.
I explain the consequences of that more fully in that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2PkkMS2Ack">Loop Better talk</a> I mentioned above.</p>

<h2>Why make an iterator?</h2>

<p>Iterators allow you to make an iterable that computes its items as it goes.
Which means that you can make iterables that are <strong>lazy</strong>, in that they don&rsquo;t determine what their next item is until you ask them for it.</p>

<p>Using an iterator instead of a list, set, or another iterable data structure can sometimes allow us to save memory.
For example, we can use <code>itertools.repeat</code> to create an iterable that provides 100 million <code>4</code>&rsquo;s to us:</p>

<pre><code class="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; from itertools import repeat
&gt;&gt;&gt; lots_of_fours = repeat(4, times=100_000_000)
</code></pre>

<p>This iterator takes up 56 bytes of memory on my machine:</p>

<pre><code class="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; import sys
&gt;&gt;&gt; sys.getsizeof(lots_of_fours)
56
</code></pre>

<p>An equivalent list of 100 million <code>4</code>&rsquo;s takes up many megabytes of memory:</p>

<pre><code class="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; lots_of_fours = [4] * 100_000_000
&gt;&gt;&gt; import sys
&gt;&gt;&gt; sys.getsizeof(lots_of_fours)
800000064
</code></pre>

<p>While iterators can save memory, they can also save time.
For example if you wanted to print out just the first line of a 10 gigabyte log file, you could do this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; print(next(open('giant_log_file.txt')))
This is the first line in a giant file
</code></pre>

<p>File objects in Python are implemented as iterators.
As you loop over a file, data is read into memory one line at a time.
If we instead used the <code>readlines</code> method to store all lines in memory, we might run out of system memory.</p>

<p>So <strong>iterators can save us memory</strong>, but <strong>iterators can sometimes save us time</strong> also.</p>

<p>Additionally, <strong>iterators have abilities that other iterables don&rsquo;t</strong>.
For example, the laziness of iterables can be used to make iterables that have an unknown length.
In fact, you can even make infinitely long iterators.</p>

<p>For example, the <code>itertools.count</code> utility will give us an iterator that will provide every number from <code>0</code> upward as we loop over it:</p>

<pre><code class="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; from itertools import count
&gt;&gt;&gt; for n in count():
...     print(n)
...
0
1
2
(this goes on forever)
</code></pre>

<p>That <code>itertools.count</code> object is essentially an infinitely long iterable.
And it&rsquo;s implemented as an iterator.</p>

<h2>Making an iterator: the object-oriented way</h2>

<p>So we&rsquo;ve seen that iterators can save us memory, save us CPU time, and unlock new abilities to us.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s make our own iterators.
We&rsquo;ll start be re-inventing the <code>itertools.count</code> iterator object.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an iterator implemented using a class:</p>

<pre><code class="python">class Count:

    """Iterator that counts upward forever."""

    def __init__(self, start=0):
        self.num = start

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        num = self.num
        self.num += 1
        return num
</code></pre>

<p>This class has an initializer that initializes our current number to <code>0</code> (or whatever is passed in as the <code>start</code>).
The things that make this class usable as an iterator are the <code>__iter__</code> and <code>__next__</code> methods.</p>

<p>When an object is passed to the <code>str</code> built-in function, its <code>__str__</code> method is called.
When an object is passed to the <code>len</code> built-in function, its <code>__len__</code> method is called.</p>

<pre><code class="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers = [1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; str(numbers), numbers.__str__()
('[1, 2, 3]', '[1, 2, 3]')
&gt;&gt;&gt; len(numbers), numbers.__len__()
(3, 3)
</code></pre>

<p>Calling the built-in <code>iter</code> function on an object will attempt to call its <code>__iter__</code> method.
Calling the built-in <code>next</code> function on an object will attempt to call its <code>__next__</code> method.</p>

<p>The <code>iter</code> function is supposed to return an iterator.
So our <code>__iter__</code> function must return an iterator.
But <strong>our object is an iterator</strong>, so should return ourself.
Therefore our <code>Count</code> object returns <code>self</code> from its <code>__iter__</code> method because it is <em>its own iterator</em>.</p>

<p>The <code>next</code> function is supposed to return the next item in our iterator or raise a <code>StopIteration</code> exception when there are no more items.
We&rsquo;re returning the current number and incrementing the number so it&rsquo;ll be larger during the next <code>__next__</code> call.</p>

<p>We can manually loop over our <code>Count</code> iterator class like this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; c = Count()
&gt;&gt;&gt; next(c)
0
&gt;&gt;&gt; next(c)
1
</code></pre>

<p>We could also loop over our <code>Count</code> object like using a <code>for</code> loop, as with any other iterable:</p>

<pre><code class="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; for n in Count():
...     print(n)
...
0
1
2
(this goes on forever)
</code></pre>

<p>This object-oriented approach to making an iterator is cool, but it&rsquo;s not the usual way that Python programmers make iterators.
Usually when we want an iterator, we make a generator.</p>

<h2>Generators: the easy way to make an iterator</h2>

<p>The easiest ways to make our own iterators in Python is to create a generator.</p>

<p>There are two ways to make generators in Python.</p>

<p>Given this list of numbers:</p>

<pre><code class="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; favorite_numbers = [6, 57, 4, 7, 68, 95]
</code></pre>

<p>We can make a generator that will lazily provide us with all the squares of these numbers like this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; def square_all(numbers):
...     for n in numbers:
...         yield n**2
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; squares = square_all(favorite_numbers)
</code></pre>

<p>Or we can make the same generator like this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; squares = (n**2 for n in favorite_numbers)
</code></pre>

<p>The first one is called a <strong>generator function</strong> and the second one is called a <strong>generator expression</strong>.</p>

<p>Both of these generator objects work the same way.
They both have a type of <code>generator</code> and they&rsquo;re both iterators that provide squares of the numbers in our numbers list.</p>

<pre><code class="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; type(squares)
&lt;class 'generator'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; next(squares)
36
&gt;&gt;&gt; next(squares)
3249
</code></pre>

<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about both of these approaches to making a generator, but first let&rsquo;s talk about terminology.</p>

<p>The word &ldquo;generator&rdquo; is used in quite a few ways in Python:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <strong>generator</strong>, also called a <strong>generator object</strong>, is an iterator whose type is <code>generator</code></li>
<li>A <strong>generator function</strong> is a special syntax that allows us to make a function which returns a <strong>generator object</strong> when we call it</li>
<li>A <strong>generator expression</strong> is a comprehension-like syntax that allows you to create a <strong>generator object</strong> inline</li>
</ul>


<p>With that terminology out of the way, let&rsquo;s take a look at each one of these things individually.
We&rsquo;ll look at generator functions first.</p>

<h2>Generator functions</h2>

<p>Generator functions are distinguished from plain old functions by the fact that they have one or more <code>yield</code> statements.</p>

<p>Normally when you call a function, its code is executed:</p>

<pre><code class="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; def gimme4_please():
...     print("Let me go get that number for you.")
...     return 4
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; num = gimme4_please()
Let me go get that number for you.
&gt;&gt;&gt; num
4
</code></pre>

<p>But if the function has a <code>yield</code> statement in it, it isn&rsquo;t a typical function anymore.
It&rsquo;s now a <strong>generator function</strong>, meaning it will return a <strong>generator object</strong> when called.
That generator object can be looped over to execute it until a <code>yield</code> statement is hit:</p>

<pre><code class="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; def gimme4_later_please():
...     print("Let me go get that number for you.")
...     yield 4
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; get4 = gimme4_later_please()
&gt;&gt;&gt; get4
&lt;generator object gimme4_later_please at 0x7f78b2e7e2b0&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; num = next(get4)
Let me go get that number for you.
&gt;&gt;&gt; num
4
</code></pre>

<p>The mere presence of a <code>yield</code> statement turns a function into a generator function.
If you see a function and there&rsquo;s a <code>yield</code>, you&rsquo;re working with a different animal.
It&rsquo;s a bit odd, but that&rsquo;s the way generator functions work.</p>

<p>Okay let&rsquo;s look at a real example of a generator function.
We&rsquo;ll make a generator function that does the same thing as our <code>Count</code> iterator class we made earlier.</p>

<pre><code class="python">def count(start=0):
    num = start
    while True:
        yield num
        num += 1
</code></pre>

<p>Just like our <code>Count</code> iterator class, we can manually loop over the generator we get back from calling <code>count</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; c = count()
&gt;&gt;&gt; next(c)
0
&gt;&gt;&gt; next(c)
1
</code></pre>

<p>And we can loop over this generator object using a <code>for</code> loop, just like before:</p>

<pre><code class="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; for n in count():
...     print(n)
...
0
1
2
(this goes on forever)
</code></pre>

<p>But this function is considerably shorter than our <code>Count</code> class we created before.</p>

<h2>Generator expressions</h2>

<p>Generator expressions are a list comprehension-like syntax that allow us to make a generator object.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say we have a list comprehension that filters empty lines from a file and strips newlines from the end:</p>

<pre><code class="python">lines = [
    line.rstrip('\n')
    for line in poem_file
    if line != '\n'
]
</code></pre>

<p>We could create a generator instead of a list, by turning the square brackets of that comprehension into parenthesis:</p>

<pre><code class="python">lines = (
    line.rstrip('\n')
    for line in poem_file
    if line != '\n'
)
</code></pre>

<p>Just as our list comprehension gave us a list back, our <strong>generator expression</strong> gives us a <strong>generator object</strong> back:</p>

<pre><code class="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; type(lines)
&lt;class 'generator'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; next(lines)
' This little bag I hope will prove'
&gt;&gt;&gt; next(lines)
'To be not vainly made--'
</code></pre>

<p>Generator expressions use a shorter inline syntax compared to generator functions.
They&rsquo;re not as powerful though.</p>

<p>If you can write your generator function in this form:</p>

<pre><code class="python">def get_a_generator(some_iterable):
    for item in some_iterable:
        if some_condition(item):
            yield item
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can replace it with a generator expression:</p>

<pre><code class="python">def get_a_generator(some_iterable):
    return (
        item
        for item in some_iterable
        if some_condition(item)
    )
</code></pre>

<p>If you can&rsquo;t write your generator function in that form, then you can&rsquo;t create a generator expression to replace it.</p>

<h2>Generator expressions vs generator functions</h2>

<p>You can think of generator expressions as the list comprehensions of the generator world.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re not familiar with list comprehensions, I recommend reading my article on <a href="http://treyhunner.com/2015/12/python-list-comprehensions-now-in-color/">list comprehensions in Python</a>.
I note in that article that you can copy-paste your way from a <code>for</code> loop to a list comprehension.</p>

<p>You can also copy-paste your way from a generator function to a function that returns a generator expression:</p>

<p><img src="/images/generator-expression-copy-paste.gif"></p>

<p>Generator expressions are to generator functions as list comprehensions are to a simple <code>for</code> loop with an append and a condition.</p>

<p>Generator expressions are so similar to comprehensions, that you might even be tempted to say <strong>generator comprehension</strong> instead of generator expression.
That&rsquo;s not technically the correct name, but if you say it everyone will know what you&rsquo;re talking about.
Ned Batchelder actually proposed that we should all <a href="https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201605/generator_comprehensions.html">start calling generator expressions generator comprehensions</a> and I tend to agree that this would be a clearer name.</p>

<h2>So what&rsquo;s the best way to make an iterator?</h2>

<p>To make an iterator you could create an iterator class, a generator function, or a generator expression.
Which way is the best way though?</p>

<p>Generator expressions are <strong>very succinct</strong>, but they&rsquo;re <strong>not nearly as flexible</strong> as generator functions.
Generator functions are flexible, but if you need to <strong>attach extra methods or attributes</strong> to your iterator object, you&rsquo;ll probably need to switch to using an iterator class.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d recommend reaching for generator expressions the same way you reach for list comprehensions.
If you&rsquo;re doing a simple <strong>mapping or filtering operation</strong>, a <strong>generator expression</strong> is a great solution.
If you&rsquo;re doing something <strong>a bit more sophisticated</strong>, you&rsquo;ll likely need a <strong>generator function</strong>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d recommend using generator functions the same way you&rsquo;d use <code>for</code> loops that append to a list.
Everywhere you&rsquo;d see an <code>append</code> method, you&rsquo;d often see a <code>yield</code> statement instead.</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;d say that you should <strong>almost never create an iterator class</strong>.
If you find you need an iterator class, try to write a generator function that does what you need and see how it compares to your iterator class.</p>

<h2>Generators can help when making iterables too</h2>

<p>You&rsquo;ll see iterator classes in the wild, but there&rsquo;s rarely a good opportunity to write your own.</p>

<p>While it&rsquo;s rare to create your own iterator class, it&rsquo;s not as unusual to make your own iterable class.
And iterable classes require a <code>__iter__</code> method which returns an iterator.
Since generators are the easy way to make an iterator, we can use a generator function or a generator expression to create our <code>__iter__</code> methods.</p>

<p>For example here&rsquo;s an iterable that provides x-y coordinates:</p>

<pre><code class="python">class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x, self.y = x, y
    def __iter__(self):
        yield self.x
        yield self.y
</code></pre>

<p>Note that our <code>Point</code> class here creates an <strong>iterable</strong> when called (not an iterator).
That means our <code>__iter__</code> method must return an iterator.
The easiest way to create an iterator is by making a generator function, so that&rsquo;s just what we did.</p>

<p>We stuck <code>yield</code> in our <code>__iter__</code> to make it into a generator function and now our <code>Point</code> class can be looped over, just like any other iterable.</p>

<pre><code class="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; p = Point(1, 2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; x, y = p
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(x, y)
1 2
&gt;&gt;&gt; list(p)
[1, 2]
</code></pre>

<p>Generator functions are a natural fit for creating <code>__iter__</code> methods on your iterable classes.</p>

<h2>Generators are <em>the</em> way to make iterators</h2>

<p>Dictionaries are the typical way to make a mapping in Python.
Functions are the typical way to make a callable object in Python.
Likewise, <strong>generators are the typical way to make an iterator in Python</strong>.</p>

<p>So when you&rsquo;re thinking &ldquo;it sure would be nice to implement an iterable that lazily computes things as it&rsquo;s looped over,&rdquo; think of iterators.</p>

<p>And when you&rsquo;re considering <strong>how to create your own iterator</strong>, think of <strong>generator functions</strong> and <strong>generator expressions</strong>.</p>

<h2>Practice making an iterator right now</h2>

    <updated>2018-04-30T08:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>https://treyhunner.com/2018/04/how-to-make-the-most-of-your-first-pycon</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Update (2019)</strong>: I originally left the sprints out of this article completely!
To remedy that, I&rsquo;ve recently published another article <a href="https://treyhunner.com/2019/04/making-the-most-of-the-pycon-sprints/">all about the PyCon sprints</a> and why you should consider attending them.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve decided to invest energy, money, and time away from your home so that you can go to your first PyCon.
Now you want to make sure you spend your time wisely by attending events relevant to you and possibly by forming relations with other PyCon attendees.
But you&rsquo;re (naturally) not an expert conference-goer.
How do you do this?
How do you make the most of your first PyCon?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m an introvert by nature, but I have increased my ability to socialize with others over the years through practice, gamification of social situations, and learning my limits.</p>

<p>Over the last few years, I&rsquo;ve interviewed many PyCon attendees on <a href="http://weeklypython.chat">Weekly Python Chat</a> and I&rsquo;ve spoken with many first-time PyCon-goers about making the most of PyCon.
It&rsquo;s difficult to describe what PyCon is like to first-time attendees and it&rsquo;s even more difficult to identify how any one person should spend their time at PyCon.
So I&rsquo;m writing this article to compile some of the advice I&rsquo;ve heard from others and to address some of the common fears I hear among first-time PyCon attendees.
Not all of the suggestions below will be right for you, so try to take the advice that works well for you.</p>

<p>Before you read any further, I have to link you to the <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2019/events/newcomer_orientation/">Newcomer Orientation</a>.
This is a new event hosted by Adrienne Lowe this year.
If this is your first PyCon, I&rsquo;d definitely recommend showing up early to the newcomer orientation and get your footing before the big event starts.</p>

<h3>Spending your time: which talks should I go to? 🤔</h3>

<p>The talks at PyCon are typically <strong>uploaded to YouTube within 24 hours after the talk ends</strong>.
That means that you can spend your evening watching the talks you missed the day before or you can watch the talks when you go home.
I&rsquo;m not suggesting you shouldn&rsquo;t watch talks at PyCon.
I am suggesting that <strong>you don&rsquo;t need to worry about attending every talk</strong>.</p>

<p>So how should I decide which talks to go to?
I&rsquo;ve chatted with folks who purposely go exclusively to talks on topics they&rsquo;re not normally interested in.
I also know people who <strong>love going to the keynotes and the lightning talks</strong> but hang out in the hallway (I&rsquo;ll talk about the hallway track later) or attend open spaces the rest of the time.
I&rsquo;m personally one of those people who <strong>attends very few talks</strong> and spends a lot of time in open spaces and the in hallway.</p>

<p><strong>You cannot and will not do everything there is to do at PyCon</strong>.</p>

<p>I suggest embracing this idea by chatting with others about things you&rsquo;ve missed out on.
<strong>People often enjoy reflecting on a talk they just watched</strong> the same way you might want to reflect on a movie.
If you meet someone who just came out of a talk you missed, ask them what it was like and what they learned from it.
They might say &ldquo;eh, it wasn&rsquo;t for me&rdquo; or they might ramble about how exciting it was.</p>

<p>Consider these things before walking into a talk:</p>

<ul>
<li>Would it be nice to show up to this talk a few minutes early and focus my attention on it?</li>
<li>Do I want to possibly ask the speaker a question during Q&amp;A?  (tips for Q&amp;A <a href="https://kev.inburke.com/kevin/how-not-to-ask-questions-at-conference/">here</a> and <a href="https://networkingnerd.net/2016/11/09/how-to-ask-a-question-at-a-conference/">here</a>)</li>
<li>Am I having a conversation that I&rsquo;d really like to continue instead of attending this talk?</li>
<li>Should I take a personal break during this time instead?</li>
</ul>


<p>Remember that PyCon is less about the talks than the discussions that happen around them.
Talks are a wonderful tool to start discussions, but they&rsquo;re not the only way to spark conversation.</p>

<h3>Open spaces: attend them and consider hosting your own! 👐</h3>

<p><a href="https://us.pycon.org/2019/events/open-spaces/">Open spaces</a> are <strong>community-run mini meetup events and they aren&rsquo;t decided before PyCon starts</strong>.
The way it works is that someone puts an index card on the open spaces board to indicate that they&rsquo;re holding an event at a particular time in one of the open spaces rooms that day.
Then others check the open spaces board throughout the day and attend ones they&rsquo;re interested in.</p>

<p>During every talk at PyCon there are at least 4 other talks happening.
There are also 9 open spaces rooms though.
So you&rsquo;re missing out on over 90% of PyCon at any time!</p>

<p>When choosing between an open space and a talk, I usually choose the open space.</p>

<p>There are a few reasons I often pick open spaces over talks:</p>

<ol>
<li>Often the <strong>open spaces are more niche and topical than the talks</strong>: there are some subjects that exist in open spaces every year but which I&rsquo;ve never seen a talk on</li>
<li><strong>Open spaces are all about interaction and discussion</strong> whereas talks are a monologue that often evolves into subsequent dialogues</li>
<li><strong>Open spaces aren&rsquo;t recorded whereas the talks are</strong>, meaning you can&rsquo;t really catch up on them later</li>
</ol>


<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for kinship and conversation, the open spaces a great place to look.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re hoping to <em>start</em> a discussion, I&rsquo;d also recommend <a href="https://pycon.blogspot.com/2018/04/keep-eye-out-for-open-space-events-at.html">creating your own open space</a> during PyCon.
The PyCon blog will be publishing a post on open spaces soon which I co-authored.</p>

<p>Disclaimed after the fact: I&rsquo;m one of the volunteer open spaces co-chairs, so I&rsquo;m biased in my love for them.</p>

<h3>Feeling like an imposter or an outsider 🌪</h3>

<p>A common fear when attending PyCon is that people will judge you because you aren&rsquo;t as skilled as they are.</p>

<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re new to Python and you&rsquo;re worried your peers won&rsquo;t accept you because you think you might be years-off from matching their skills.
Maybe you&rsquo;re &ldquo;not a developer&rdquo; and you&rsquo;re afraid you&rsquo;ll feel like an imposter at PyCon.</p>

<p>Not feeling like you&rsquo;ll be smart enough or skilled enough to understand the talks and conversations you&rsquo;ll be in is a big and intimidating thought.
If you&rsquo;re afraid of folks misjudging your expertise, it may help to plan out a few techniques for presenting yourself in a way that makes you feel comfortable.</p>

<p>You might rehearse a few different very <strong>brief elevator pitches</strong>.
Here are some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m a JavaScript developer here to meet folks in the Python world</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m a new programmer and I&rsquo;m here because I&rsquo;ve been told the Python community was pretty welcoming to newcomers</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t consider myself a developer, but I do write Python code at work to automate things and I&rsquo;m here to learn more</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t write code for work, but I have some side projects that I&rsquo;m using Python for.  So I&rsquo;m here to learn and meet friendly people.</li>
</ul>


<p>Remember that <strong>you do not need to justify your presence at PyCon</strong>.
If you believe you belong at PyCon, then you do.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in the conversation you&rsquo;re in, others may mirror that interest.
If you&rsquo;re enthusiastic about learning new things, others you meet may mirror that enthusiasm.
I&rsquo;ve witnessed quite a few conversations at PyCon that included phrases like &ldquo;oh you don&rsquo;t know about X?  Cool, essentially it&rsquo;s&hellip;&rdquo;
You&rsquo;ll hopefully find that many of the more long-time PyCon attendees go out of their way to welcome beginners.
This is not a universal phenomenon and even folks with good intentions can alienate those around them.</p>

<h3>Tips for starting conversation 💬</h3>

<p>Make sure to treat each person you meet as new.
<strong>Not everyone you meet will be at the conference for the same reasons as you are</strong>.
Some people write code but don&rsquo;t know Python, some people only using a little bit of Python and don&rsquo;t consider themselves developers, some people don&rsquo;t work in tech, and some people don&rsquo;t write code for work at all and may be considering whether they should make a career transition into tech.
Just as you don&rsquo;t need to justify your presence at PyCon to anyone, no one needs to justify their presence to you.</p>

<p>I mentioned above that you might want to make an elevator pitch or two for yourself.
You might also want to consider how you&rsquo;ll respond to some of the questions that will come up frequently, like &ldquo;what do you do?&rdquo; or &ldquo;where do you work?&rdquo;.
You will be asked some of the same questions over and over when meeting new people.
<strong>Knowing how you&rsquo;ll respond to common questions will help put your mind at ease when meeting new people</strong>.</p>

<p>I also recommend occasionally considering what questions you ask, why you&rsquo;re asking them, and the phrasing you use.
Also notice how others ask questions and consider what questions and phrases seem to put others at ease and lead to interesting conversations.
Conversations often go pretty well if you <strong>ask questions that make others feel comfortable and appreciated</strong>.</p>

<h3>Tips for breakfast and lunch time 🍽</h3>

<p>How do lunch and breakfast work?
Can I just sit with anyone or should I choose an empty table?
Are people going to be nice to me?
Do I need to introduce myself when I sit down?</p>

<p>Meal dynamics are interesting because there&rsquo;s not really a rule book for these social dynamics.
Below is what I&rsquo;ve observed over the years.</p>

<p><strong>At lunch and breakfast, you can sit anywhere</strong>.
Often people will ask &ldquo;is this seat taken&rdquo; when sitting down just in case a group of acquaintances are waiting on another person to join them.
Sometimes when a new person joins your table, a particularly friendly person at the table (if one exists) will introduce themselves to make that newcomer feel welcome.
Often this entails a name, a smile, and a wave or a nod.
Beyond these typical social norms, everything else can differ based on the folks sitting at your table (that includes you!).</p>

<p>Sometimes a couple people at a table will be very interested to know what brings everyone to the conference and what each person &ldquo;does&rdquo;.
<strong>Meals are a good time to test out your elevator pitch</strong> when introducing yourself to see how the conversation goes and to verify that it makes you feel comfortable.</p>

<p>Sometimes people will be more interested in either sitting quietly or talking to a particular person or two with whom they&rsquo;ve found something interesting to discuss.
Personally I often find myself asking others where they&rsquo;re traveling from, whether it&rsquo;s their first year attending, what they&rsquo;ve thought of the conference so far, and <strong>what inspired them to come to PyCon</strong>.
I tend to leave questions about employment and jobs for later because folks will often bring up their work (if they want to) on their own.</p>

<h3>The hallway track 👣</h3>

<p>Something you might consider doing while at PyCon is <strong>taking breaks in the hallway</strong>.
Sit at a table in the open and if someone asks whether they can sit at your table say something inviting/friendly like &ldquo;sure! I&rsquo;m YOUR_NAME. Nice to meet you new friend!&rdquo; (or just smile and gesture in a friendly way if you&rsquo;re not feeling adventurous in the moment).
Chatting with folks in the hallway in an unstructured way is often referred to as the <a href="http://www.ericmjl.com/blog/2016/6/3/the-pycon-ers-guide-to-the-hallway-track/">hallway track</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to joining or starting a table in the hallway, consider identifying groups that have <a href="http://ericholscher.com/blog/2017/aug/2/pacman-rule-conferences/">a PacMan opening</a> to join and make sure the groups you&rsquo;re in are PacMan-friendly.</p>

<p>While chatting with new friends, giving one person your full attention in a 5 minute conversation is often more rewarding and memorable than having five 1 minute conversations with different people.
But do keep in mind though that <strong>if you&rsquo;re no longer interested in a conversation or activity, you don&rsquo;t need to keep it going</strong>.
There are lots of things going on at any one time at PyCon and lots of people there.
It&rsquo;s not unusual to say &ldquo;nice talking to you&rdquo; and leave one conversation to walk off to another conversation or to something else entirely.</p>

<h3>Don&rsquo;t just follow the rules: be compassionate 💖</h3>

<p>You&rsquo;re at a professional event.
You should absolutely try to have fun and derive as much value as you can from PyCon, but you always want to make sure you feel welcome, comfortable, and safe.
Importantly, you should also be mindful to make sure those around you feel the same way.
Please <strong>be cognizant of the preferences of those around you and be respectful of their needs</strong>.</p>

<p>PyCon has a <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2019/about/code-of-conduct/">code of conduct</a>.
Read it.
I expect you to go beyond embracing the law of the code of conduct.
I&rsquo;d like you to embrace the spirit of the code of conduct as well.</p>

<p>When meeting people in general, <strong>make sure to be nice</strong>.
Don&rsquo;t talk down to people, don&rsquo;t insult people, and don&rsquo;t treat anyone like they don&rsquo;t belong or aren&rsquo;t worthy.
<strong>The Python community prides itself on being nice</strong> and we expect you to be nice as well.
Be kind, be compassionate, be considerate.</p>

<p>On that note, you may run into folks who act unkind or make you feel unwelcome at some point.
It&rsquo;s okay to cut and run at any point during any conversation or event.
If you don&rsquo;t feel welcome, I recommend <strong>removing yourself from the space you&rsquo;re in and contacting one of the staff members</strong> listed on <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2019/about/code-of-conduct/">the code of conduct page</a>.
Even if you just want to say &ldquo;hey something happened that could maybe be avoided in the future,&rdquo; it would be wonderful if you could muster the courage to contact a staff member.
<strong>PyCon tries to improve every year and feedback is the way that happens</strong>.</p>

<h3>Interacting online during PyCon 🐦</h3>

<p>After PyCon is over, some people occasionally follow-up with folks they met over email.
Sometimes people will add each other on LinkedIn or Facebook also.
But the means of interaction I&rsquo;ve noticed most is Twitter.
I&rsquo;m unlikely to send most of the people I meet at PyCon an email, but I try to add most of the people I meet to my <a href="https://twitter.com/treyhunner/lists/pycon-2017/members">PyCon list</a> on Twitter.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re not completely opposed to it, <strong>I recommend getting a Twitter account to make it easier to passively keep up with folks from PyCon after the conference ends</strong>.
You don&rsquo;t have to use Twitter all the time to get value from it, you could just use it as a modern day <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolodex">rolodex</a> of sorts.
Twitter isn&rsquo;t the only way people stay in touch, but it&rsquo;s an extremely easy passive way to stay in touch.</p>

<p>If you do get a Twitter account, I recommend adding a saved search for &ldquo;pycon2019 OR pycon&rdquo; to your Twitter app or to <a href="https://tweetdeck.twitter.com">TweetDeck</a> (if you use it) to <strong>follow a bit of the random PyCon-related Twitter chatter during the conference</strong> and to like/reply/interact with others online.</p>

<p>Sometimes <strong>people on Twitter will ask if anyone would like to join them for dinner</strong> and you might decide to reply and say you&rsquo;d like to join.
Sometimes you&rsquo;ll recognize the face or name of someone you met over breakfast or someone you recognize from another part of the internet.
If you&rsquo;re feeling comfortable with it, you could send a tweet to that person to ask if they&rsquo;d like to meet up and chat during one of the breaks.</p>

<p>However, I keep in mind when you meet people that people are just people.
If you think someone is famous or important or smart, don&rsquo;t treat them like they&rsquo;re a celebrity or like they&rsquo;re superior to you.
<strong>It&rsquo;s wonderful to show appreciation for what someone does</strong>.
But keep in mind that <strong>most people feel awkward when they feel like they&rsquo;re being put on a pedestal</strong>.
Treat folks you meet as your equals.</p>

<h3>Networking isn&rsquo;t a dirty word: it means making friends 👥</h3>

<p>I hear two opposing concerns sometimes expressed about PyCon:</p>

<ol>
<li>Isn&rsquo;t everyone here to get a job or hire people?</li>
<li>Is it acceptable to go to PyCon looking for a job?</li>
</ol>


<p>PyCon is a networking event.
That doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean everyone is there to get a job, but it also definitely doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s unacceptable to job-seek at Python.</p>

<p>There is <strong>no shame in going to PyCon with the goal of getting a new job</strong>.
Many of the sponsors in the Expo hall are looking to hire new developers and events like the job fair are specifically designed to bring together folks seeking work and folks seeking workers.
But <strong>if you are not at PyCon to get a job or to hire someone else, that&rsquo;s absolutely okay also</strong>!</p>

<p>The focus of PyCon is on <strong>meeting people and sharing experiences</strong> and that can come in a <em>lot</em> of different forms.
Sometimes the people you meet will end up being your coworkers one day, sometimes they&rsquo;re folks you&rsquo;d like to keep in touch with, and sometimes they&rsquo;re just a friendly unnamed Pythonistas you once had a good conversation with.</p>

<p>PyCon is a networking event and networking isn&rsquo;t a dirty word.
<strong>Networking means meeting new people</strong>.
I&rsquo;ve met a <em>lot</em> of people at PyCon who I care deeply about.
Some of them I haven&rsquo;t seen in years and only keep in touch with sporadically through social media, some I see once or twice each year, and some I chat with on a weekly basis online.</p>

<p>Speaking of networking, there&rsquo;s a <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2019/events/speed_networking/">Speed Networking</a> event during the opening reception at PyCon this year that I&rsquo;d recommend going to.</p>

<p>Whatever your goals are at PyCon, try <strong>savor the experiences you have</strong> while there.</p>

<h3>Be prepared to keep in touch 📇</h3>

<p>How am I supposed to remember all these amazing people I met!
Should I bring business cards and if so how many?
How should I follow up with people after the conference?</p>

<p>If you have a good conversation with someone, I&rsquo;d recommend exchanging information with them.
I&rsquo;ve seen people <strong>write email addresses on napkins</strong>.
I&rsquo;ve also frequently seen people exchange business cards or name cards.
Sometimes people simply <strong>write down Twitter handles</strong> or even ask to take a picture of a face and a badge.
As I noted above, I like to get people&rsquo;s Twitter handles and add them to a <a href="https://twitter.com/treyhunner/lists/pycon-2017/members">PyCon list</a> I maintain for myself.
I also exchange business cards and other forms of contact information.</p>

<p>Being handed a business card doesn&rsquo;t mean &ldquo;this is a business interaction and we are fancy business people&rdquo;.
If someone hands you a business card, it usually means they appreciated the conversation they had with you and they&rsquo;d like to keep in touch (or at least allow for that possibility).
Sometimes it means they want to hire you, but often they simply want a way to remember your name so they can find you on social media or send you an email later.</p>

<p>The tricky part is remembering to stay in touch when you go home and remembering which people you had which conversations with.
It&rsquo;s not unusual for people to <strong>take notes on business cards about what they talked about with you and why</strong>.
I think this is a great strategy for remembering who you&rsquo;re most interested in sending a kind note to after you go home and I wish I remembered to do this more often.</p>

<p>This blog post on <a href="http://swombat.com/2011/2/25/kevin-mcdonagh-how-to-attend-a-conference">how to attend a conference</a> has recommendations for staying in touch (as well as many other recommendations).</p>

<h3>Evening events: dinners and board games 🃏</h3>

<p>What do people do for dinner?
How do they organize?
How late do they stay?
Is there dinner at the conference center, if you don&rsquo;t want to go out?
How do I find people to go to dinner with if I don&rsquo;t know anyone?
Also I know that there are some informal get-togethers at the conference.
How do I propose them?
How do I know what&rsquo;s there?</p>

<p>One trick that I&rsquo;ve used and I&rsquo;ve seen others use: <strong>make a game of inviting people you don&rsquo;t really know well to dinner</strong>.
If you&rsquo;re nervous about being with lots of new people, <strong>find a couple familiar people and ask each to invite just 1 person</strong>.
If you&rsquo;d like to do dinner in a very small group, post on Twitter and say: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for a small dinner group and I&rsquo;m looking for exactly 1 or 2 or 3 (your choice) other people to do dinner with.  Any takers?&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Sometimes people make a reservation at a restaurant and hope they can find people to join them.
I&rsquo;m not that gutsy and I usually prefer to gather people until I have a headcount and then call a nearby restaurant to ask if a reservation is needed.
During your first conference I&rsquo;m recommend <strong>walking up to a group of folks and asking &ldquo;does anyone have dinner plans?&rdquo;</strong>
Often the response will be &ldquo;we&rsquo;re trying to figure that out now, want to join us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As far as events in the evening besides dinner go, there&rsquo;s a variety of options usually.
Some people go out drinking.
I don&rsquo;t drink, so I don&rsquo;t do this but I&rsquo;ve also heard the recommendation from drinkers that <strong>it&rsquo;s a very bad idea to drink heavily during a conference</strong>.
You&rsquo;re with people you don&rsquo;t know in a new community: don&rsquo;t increase the chance that you might alienate someone by doing something you regret.
I&rsquo;m very biased here, but I&rsquo;d drinking very moderately if you drink at all during PyCon.</p>

<p>One thing you&rsquo;ll likely see a lot of during PyCon is board games.
Folks often play board games in the hotel lobbies, in board game bars, and even in the open spaces!
PyCon&rsquo;s open spaces usually involve some evening time for after hour events and board games are frequently one of those events.
There&rsquo;s usually <strong>at least one night with a semi-official board game open spaces</strong> event, but there are often others that appear.
You could even put your own board game open space event on the board!</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t mention board games without mentioning my absolute favorite conference ice breaker: <strong>the cabo card game</strong>.
I&rsquo;ve played Cabo at <a href="https://twitter.com/treyhunner/status/573027732902133760">most</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/treyhunner/status/587086868396822528">tech</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/algosuna/status/641421944005378048">conferences</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/treyhunner/status/746454264495513601">I&rsquo;ve</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/treyhunner/status/755887571264212993">been</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/treyhunner/status/897971022334382080">to</a>.
I love Cabo because it only requires a 52 card deck and using the phrase &ldquo;want to learn a 20 minute card game that I guarantee you&rsquo;ve never heard of&rdquo; seems to allow people to let their guard down and meet new people (not everyone says yes, but many people do).
If you&rsquo;d like to try playing Cabo yourself, you can read my blog post on <a href="http://treyhunner.com/2015/06/cabo-card-game/">the rules to the Cabo card game</a>.</p>

<p>The thing I love about nearly all forms of games is that your technical interests or expertise don&rsquo;t usually matter when you&rsquo;re playing a game.
You can bond with people without have any deep conversation at all.
I&rsquo;ve met people the day after playing a long game and <strong>felt like I already knew them even though I didn&rsquo;t even know their name yet</strong>.</p>

<h3>Volunteering 💝</h3>

<p>If you&rsquo;re the type of person who derives comfort from understanding and being part of the inner workings of a community event, I recommend <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2019/about/volunteers/">volunteering to help out while at PyCon</a>.</p>

<p>You might think it&rsquo;s premature to volunteer during your first PyCon and for some roles, it likely is.
You probably shouldn&rsquo;t volunteer to be a session chair during your first PyCon for example because that&rsquo;s a big role.
But you could absolutely be part of the <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2019/about/volunteers/#swag">swag bag stuffing</a>, which is a way to see lots friendly of faces while being a smiling cog in a bag-stuff assembly line.</p>

<p>You could also volunteer to help <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2019/about/volunteers/#swag_dist">hand out swag bags</a>, act as a friendly <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2019/about/volunteers/#tutorials">greeter for folks coming into tutorials</a>, or <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2019/about/volunteers/#registration">help out at the registration desk</a>.
These might sound like scary tasks, but from my experience <strong>the folks who coordinate volunteers are happy to answer questions and prepare you for your role</strong> so that you feel comfortable doing the job you&rsquo;ve signed up for.
All three of those tasks are ways to practice being a cheerful and empathetic face, which will help other first-time attendees to feel comfortable too.</p>

<p>After volunteering, people may occasionally meet you in the hall and wonder why they&rsquo;re already familiar with your friendly face.
It&rsquo;s because you handed them their badge or checked their name off a list!
Also volunteering can give you glimpse behind the scenes of PyCon and <strong>make things feel a little less scary and official</strong>.</p>

<p>If you are planning to volunteer though, make sure you block that time off on your calendar and that you show up.
<strong>Don&rsquo;t miss your volunteering time slots and leave the staff scrambling to find someone to fill in at the last minute</strong>.</p>

<p>If volunteering to be a small part of the event inner-workings isn&rsquo;t your thing, don&rsquo;t worry.
<strong>There are lots of great ways to spend your time while at PyCon</strong>!</p>

<h3>Give a lightning talk ⚡</h3>

<p>If you&rsquo;re feeling particularly bold one day, you could sign up on the <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2019/events/lightning/talks/">lightning talk board</a> to give a 5 minute lightning talk on a topic of your choosing.
This is another excuse for people to talk to you.</p>

<p>I gave my first conference lightning talk <a href="https://youtu.be/Peo-n4spSRA?t=9m59s">at DjangoCon 2015</a>, during which I compared modern JavaScript to Python.
A few people I&rsquo;d never met started a conversation with me at a bar afterward by saying &ldquo;I liked your lightning talk.&rdquo;
Lightning talks can act as an ice breaker.
If you give a talk to a giant room of people, you&rsquo;ve given everyone in that room at least a reason to talk to you.</p>

<p>If you do give a lightning talk, <strong>make sure it&rsquo;s less than 5 minutes</strong>.
You do not want to run over time in a lightning talk.
The shorter and more compact, the better.</p>

<h3>Take care of yourself 💗</h3>

<p>There&rsquo;s so many people.
What do I do if I get overwhelmed?</p>

<p>While at PyCon, you&rsquo;ll want to <strong>make sure you pace yourself</strong> and that you <strong>find a way to slow down and recharge</strong> when needed.
If you&rsquo;re an introvert, your laptop&rsquo;s batteries will likely last longer than yours before needing a recharge at PyCon.
At least once a day, I&rsquo;d recommend finding a quiet place to sit, breathe deeply, think about your day, and meditate.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t expect yourself to be able to wake up, head to the conference venue, do things at every moment during the day, and then go out with folks for dinner and more conversation in the evening.
If you know your limits, respect them.
<strong>Push yourself outside of your comfort zone, but don&rsquo;t stretch your boundaries too far</strong>.
Make sure to check in with yourself and take breaks to assess whether you need mid-day a nap or a bit of quiet alone time between lunch and dinner.
<strong>You cannot be &ldquo;on&rdquo; at every moment</strong>.</p>

<h3>Tips from others 😄</h3>

<p>I can&rsquo;t write a guide on attending PyCon without referencing a couple other wonderful guides that have been written on this topic.</p>

<p>Danny Greenfeld&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pydanny.com/beginners-guide-pycon-2014.html">Beginner&rsquo;s Guide to PyCon 2015</a> is another great guide to PyCon, with lots of tips on how to make the most of PyCon.
It&rsquo;s much more compact than my post here, so it&rsquo;s a quick and dense read.</p>

<p>Al Sweigart also talks quite a bit about his strategies for meeting new people at PyCon in his <a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/how-to-do-pycon.html">How to Do PyCon</a> post.
Al is also an introvert, but he&rsquo;s very good at gamifying socializing with others.</p>

<p>I also <strong>highly recommend asking questions</strong> to staff members, friendly-looking volunteers, and people with silly hats (some people use hats to indicate that they&rsquo;re approachable).
Different PyCon attendees will have different recommendations for how to make the most of PyCon without getting overwhelmed.</p>

<p>Also, if you see me in the hallway at PyCon (I have a face that looks like me and will like have a &ldquo;Trey Hunner&rdquo; name badge on), say hi and let me know you read this article! 😄</p>

<p>I hope you have a lovely PyCon!</p>

    <updated>2018-04-04T08:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>https://treyhunner.com/2018/04/keyword-arguments-in-python</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Keyword arguments are one of those Python features that often seems a little odd for folks moving to Python from many other programming languages.  It doesn&rsquo;t help that folks learning Python often discover the various features of keyword arguments slowly over time.</p>

<p>When teaching Python, I&rsquo;ve often wished I had a summary of the various keyword argument-related features that I could link learners to.  I hope that this article will accomplish that task.</p>

<p>In this article I&rsquo;m going to explain what keyword arguments are and why they&rsquo;re used.  I&rsquo;ll then go over some more advanced uses of them that even long-time Python programmers may have overlooked because quite a few things have changed in recent versions of Python 3.  If you&rsquo;re already an experienced Python programmer, you might want to skip to the end.</p>

<ul data-toc=".entry-content"></ul>


<h2>What are keyword arguments?</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at what keyword arguments (also called &ldquo;named arguments&rdquo;) are.</p>

<p>First let&rsquo;s take this Python function:</p>

<pre><code class="python">from math import sqrt

def quadratic(a, b, c):
    x1 = -b / (2*a)
    x2 = sqrt(b**2 - 4*a*c) / (2*a)
    return (x1 + x2), (x1 - x2)
</code></pre>

<p>When we call this function, we can pass each of our three arguments in two different ways.</p>

<p>We can pass our arguments as positional arguments like this:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; quadratic(31, 93, 62)
(-1.0, -2.0)
</code></pre>

<p>Or we can pass our arguments as keyword arguments like this:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; quadratic(a=31, b=93, c=62)
(-1.0, -2.0)
</code></pre>

<p>The order of these arguments matters when they&rsquo;re passed positionally:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; quadratic(31, 93, 62)
(-1.0, -2.0)
&gt;&gt;&gt; quadratic(62, 93, 31)
(-0.5, -1.0)
</code></pre>

<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t matter when they&rsquo;re passed by their name:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; quadratic(a=31, b=93, c=62)
(-1.0, -2.0)
&gt;&gt;&gt; quadratic(c=62, b=93, a=31)
(-1.0, -2.0)
</code></pre>

<p>When we use keyword/named arguments, it&rsquo;s the name that matters, not the position:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; quadratic(a=31, b=93, c=62)
(-1.0, -2.0)
&gt;&gt;&gt; quadratic(c=31, b=93, a=62)
(-0.5, -1.0)
</code></pre>

<p>So unlike many other programming languages, Python knows the names of the arguments our function accepts.</p>

<p>If we ask for help on our function Python will tell us our three arguments by name:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; help(quadratic)
Help on function quadratic in module __main__:

quadratic(a, b, c)
</code></pre>

<p>Note that functions can be called with a mix of positional and named arguments:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; quadratic(31, 93, c=62)
(-1.0, -2.0)
</code></pre>

<p>That can come in handy, but with the particular function we&rsquo;ve written here it&rsquo;s most clear to use all positional arguments or all keyword arguments.</p>

<h2>Why use keyword arguments?</h2>

<p>When calling functions in Python, you&rsquo;ll often have to choose between using keyword arguments or positional arguments.  Keyword arguments can often be used to make function calls more explicit.</p>

<p>Take this code:</p>

<pre><code class="python">def write_gzip_file(output_file, contents):
    with GzipFile(None, 'wt', 9, output_file) as gzip_out:
        gzip_out.write(contents)
</code></pre>

<p>This takes a file object <code>output_file</code> and <code>contents</code> string and writes a gzipped version of the string to the output file.</p>

<p>This code does the same thing but it uses keyword arguments instead of positional arguments:</p>

<pre><code class="python">def write_gzip_file(output_file, contents):
    with GzipFile(fileobj=output_file, mode='wt', compresslevel=9) as gzip_out:
        gzip_out.write(contents)
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that using this keyword argument call style made it more obvious what each of these three arguments represent.</p>

<p>We were also able to leave off an argument here.  The first argument that we left off represents a <code>filename</code> and already has a default value of <code>None</code>.  We don&rsquo;t need a <code>filename</code> here because we&rsquo;re supposed to pass either a file object or a filename to <code>GzipFile</code>, not both.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re actually able to leave another argument off though.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the same code again, but the compress level has been left at its default value of <code>9</code> this time:</p>

<pre><code class="python">def write_gzip_file(output_file, contents):
    with GzipFile(fileobj=output_file, mode='wt') as gzip_out:
        gzip_out.write(contents)
</code></pre>

<p>Because we used named arguments, we were able to leave out two arguments and rearrange the remaining 2 arguments in a sensible order (the file object is more important than the &ldquo;wt&rdquo; access mode).</p>

<p>When we use keyword arguments:</p>

<ol>
<li>We can often leave out arguments that have default values</li>
<li>We can rearrange arguments in a way that makes them most readable</li>
<li>We call arguments by their names to make it more clear what they represent</li>
</ol>


<h2>Where you see keyword arguments</h2>

<p>You&rsquo;ll likely see keyword arguments quite a bit in Python.</p>

<p>Python has a number of functions that take an unlimited number of positional arguments.  These functions sometimes have arguments that can be provided to customize their functionality.  Those arguments must be provided as named arguments to distinguish them from the unlimited positional arguments.</p>

<p>The built-in <code>print</code> function accepts the optional <code>sep</code>, <code>end</code>, <code>file</code>, and <code>flush</code> attributes as keyword-only arguments:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; print('comma', 'separated', 'words', sep=', ')
comma, separated, words
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>itertools.zip_longest</code> function also accepts an optional <code>fillvalue</code> attribute (which defaults to <code>None</code>) exclusively as a keyword argument:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; from itertools import zip_longest
&gt;&gt;&gt; list(zip_longest([1, 2], [7, 8, 9], [4, 5], fillvalue=0))
[(1, 7, 4), (2, 8, 5), (0, 9, 0)]
</code></pre>

<p>In fact, some functions in Python force arguments to be named even when they <em>could</em> have been unambiguously specified positionally.</p>

<p>In Python 2, the <code>sorted</code> function accepted all its arguments as either positional or keyword arguments:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; sorted([4, 1, 8, 2, 7], None, None, True)
[8, 7, 4, 2, 1]
&gt;&gt;&gt; sorted([4, 1, 8, 2, 7], reverse=True)
[8, 7, 4, 2, 1]
</code></pre>

<p>But Python 3&rsquo;s <code>sorted</code> function requires all arguments after the provided iterable to be specified as keyword arguments:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; sorted([4, 1, 8, 2, 7], None, True)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: must use keyword argument for key function
&gt;&gt;&gt; sorted([4, 1, 8, 2, 7], reverse=True)
[8, 7, 4, 2, 1]
</code></pre>

<p>Keyword arguments come up quite a bit in Python&rsquo;s built-in functions as well as in the standard library and third party libraries.</p>

<h2>Requiring your arguments be named</h2>

<p>You can create a function that accepts any number of positional arguments as well as some keyword-only arguments by using the <code>*</code> operator to capture all the positional arguments and then specify optional keyword-only arguments after the <code>*</code> capture.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>

<pre><code class="python">def product(*numbers, initial=1):
    total = initial
    for n in numbers:
        total *= n
    return total
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you haven&rsquo;t seen that <code>*</code> syntax before, <code>*numbers</code> captures all positional arguments given to the <code>product</code> function into a tuple which the <code>numbers</code> variable points to.</p>

<p>The <code>initial</code> argument in the above function must be specified as a keyword argument:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; product(4, 4)
16
&gt;&gt;&gt; product(4, 4, initial=1)
16
&gt;&gt;&gt; product(4, 5, 2, initial=3)
120
</code></pre>

<p>Note that while <code>initial</code> has a default value, you can also specify <em>required</em> keyword-only arguments using this syntax:</p>

<pre><code class="python">def join(*iterables, joiner):
    if not iterables:
        return
    yield from iterables[0]
    for iterable in iterables[1:]:
        yield joiner
        yield from iterable
</code></pre>

<p>That <code>joiner</code> variable doesn&rsquo;t have a default value, so it must be specified:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; list(join([1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7], joiner=0))
[1, 2, 3, 0, 4, 5, 0, 6, 7]
&gt;&gt;&gt; list(join([1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7], joiner='-'))
[1, 2, 3, '-', 4, 5, '-', 6, 7]
&gt;&gt;&gt; list(join([1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7]))
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: join() missing 1 required keyword-only argument: 'joiner'
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this syntax of putting arguments after the <code>*</code> only works in Python 3.  There&rsquo;s no syntactic way in Python 2 to require an argument to be named.</p>

<h2>Keyword-only arguments without positional arguments</h2>

<p>What if you want to accept keyword-only arguments without also accepting unlimited positional arguments?</p>

<p>If you want to accept keyword-only arguments and you&rsquo;re not using a <code>*</code> to accept any number of positional arguments, you can use a <code>*</code> without anything after it.</p>

<p>For example here&rsquo;s a modified version of Django&rsquo;s <code>django.shortcuts.render</code> function:</p>

<pre><code class="python">def render(request, template_name, context=None, *, content_type=None, status=None, using=None):
    content = loader.render_to_string(template_name, context, request, using=using)
    return HttpResponse(content, content_type, status)
</code></pre>

<p>Unlike Django&rsquo;s current implementation of <code>render</code>, this version disallows calling <code>render</code> by specifying every argument positionally.  The <code>content_type</code>, <code>status</code>, and <code>using</code> arguments must be specified by their <code>name</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; render(request, '500.html', {'error': error}, status=500)
&lt;HttpResponse status_code=500, "text/html; charset=utf-8"&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; render(request, '500.html', {'error': error}, 500)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: render() takes from 2 to 3 positional arguments but 4 were given
</code></pre>

<p>Just like with unlimited positional arguments, these keyword arguments can be required.  Here&rsquo;s a function with four required keyword-only arguments:</p>

<pre><code class="python">from random import choice, shuffle
UPPERCASE = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
LOWERCASE = UPPERCASE.lower()
DIGITS = "0123456789"
ALL = UPPERCASE + LOWERCASE + DIGITS

def random_password(*, upper, lower, digits, length):
    chars = [
        *(choice(UPPERCASE) for _ in range(upper)),
        *(choice(LOWERCASE) for _ in range(lower)),
        *(choice(DIGITS) for _ in range(digits)),
        *(choice(ALL) for _ in range(length-upper-lower-digits)),
    ]
    shuffle(chars)
    return "".join(chars)
</code></pre>

<p>This function requires all of its arguments to be specified using their name:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; random_password(upper=1, lower=1, digits=1, length=8)
'oNA7rYWI'
&gt;&gt;&gt; random_password(upper=1, lower=1, digits=1, length=8)
'bjonpuM6'
&gt;&gt;&gt; random_password(1, 1, 1, 8)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: random_password() takes 0 positional arguments but 4 were given
</code></pre>

<p>Requiring arguments to be named can make calls to our function much clearer.</p>

<p>The purpose of this function call:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; password = random_password(upper=1, lower=1, digits=1, length=8)
</code></pre>

<p>Is much more obvious than this one:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; password = random_password(1, 1, 1, 8)
</code></pre>

<p>Again note that this syntax also only works in Python 3.</p>

<h2>Capturing arbitrary keyword arguments</h2>

<p>What if you want to write a function that captures an arbitrary number of keyword arguments?</p>

<p>For example the string format method accepts any keyword argument you give it:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; "My name is {name} and I like {color}".format(name="Trey", color="purple")
'My name is Trey and I like purple'
</code></pre>

<p>How can you write such a function?</p>

<p>Python allows functions to capture any keyword arguments provided to them using the <code>**</code> operator when defining the function:</p>

<pre><code class="python">def format_attributes(**attributes):
    """Return a string of comma-separated key-value pairs."""
    return ", ".join(
        f"{param}: {value}"
        for param, value in attributes.items()
    )
</code></pre>

<p>That <code>**</code> operator will allow our <code>format_attributes</code> function to accept any number of keyword arguments.  The given arguments will be stored in a dictionary called <code>attributes</code>.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example use of our function:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; format_attributes(name="Trey", website="http://treyhunner.com", color="purple")
'name: Trey, website: http://treyhunner.com, color: purple'
</code></pre>

<h2>Calling functions with arbitrary arguments</h2>

<p>Just as you can define functions that take arbitrary keyword arguments, you can also call functions with arbitrary keyword arguments.</p>

<p>By this I mean that you can pass keyword arguments into a function based on items in a dictionary.</p>

<p>Here we&rsquo;re manually taking every key/value pair from a dictionary and passing them in as keyword arguments:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; items = {'name': "Trey", 'website': "http://treyhunner.com", 'color': "purple"}
&gt;&gt;&gt; format_attributes(name=items['name'], website=items['website'], color=items['color'])
'name: Trey, website: http://treyhunner.com, color: purple'
</code></pre>

<p>This approach of hard-coding the keyword arguments in our function call requires that we know every key in the dictionary we&rsquo;re using at the time our code is written.  This won&rsquo;t work if we have a dictionary with unknown keys.</p>

<p>We can pass arbitrary keyword arguments to our function using the <code>**</code> operator to unpack our dictionary items into keyword arguments in our function call:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; items = {'name': "Trey", 'website': "http://treyhunner.com", 'color': "purple"}
&gt;&gt;&gt; format_attributes(**items)
'name: Trey, website: http://treyhunner.com, color: purple'
</code></pre>

<p>This ability to pass arbitrary keyword arguments into functions and to accept arbitrary keyword arguments inside functions (as we did before) is seen frequently when using inheritance:</p>

<pre><code class="python">def my_method(self, *args, **kwargs):
    print('Do something interesting here')
    super().my_method(*args, **kwargs)  # Call parent method with all given arguments
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: We&rsquo;re also using the <code>*</code> operator here for the same kind of capturing and unpacking of positional arguments.</p>

<h2>Order matters</h2>

<p>Since Python 3.6, functions always preserve the order of the keyword arguments passed to them (see <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0468/">PEP 468</a>).  This means that when <code>**</code> is used to capture keyword arguments, the resulting dictionary will have keys in the same order the arguments were passed.</p>

<p>So since Python 3.6, you&rsquo;ll <em>never</em> see something like this happen:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; format_attributes(name="Trey", website="http://treyhunner.com", color="purple")
'website: http://treyhunner.com, color: purple, name: Trey'
</code></pre>

<p>Instead, with Python 3.6+, arguments will always maintain the order they were passed in:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; format_attributes(name="Trey", website="http://treyhunner.com", color="purple")
'name: Trey, website: http://treyhunner.com, color: purple'
</code></pre>

<h2>Embrace keyword arguments in Python</h2>

<p>An arguments <em>position</em> often doesn&rsquo;t convey as much meaning as its <em>name</em>.  So when calling functions, consider naming arguments that you pass in if it might make their meaning clearer.</p>

<p>When defining a new function, stop to think about which arguments should always be specified as keyword arguments when calling your function.  Consider using the <code>*</code> operator to require those arguments be specified as keyword arguments.</p>

<p>And remember that you can accept arbitrary keyword arguments to the functions you define and pass arbitrary keyword arguments to the functions you call by using the <code>**</code> operator.</p>

<p>Important objects deserve names and you can use keyword arguments to give your objects the names they deserve!</p>
