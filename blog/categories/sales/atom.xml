    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s time for my annual compilation post of <strong>Python learning deals</strong>.
I&rsquo;ve been compiling Python-related Black Friday &amp; Cyber Monday sales <a href="https://treyhunner.com/blog/categories/sales/">since 2018</a> and 2023&rsquo;s Python-related sales are coming up.</p>

<h2>Lifetime Python Morsels access for the price of two years</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m kicking things off with <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/lifetime-access-sale/">my sale</a> on Python Morsels.
Python Morsels helps developers <strong>deepen their Python skills</strong> in a way that day-to-day coding simply can&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Python Morsels is designed for:</p>

<ul>
<li>experienced developers frustrated with gaps in their Python knowledge</li>
<li>self-taught programmers seeking courage and confidence in their Python abilities</li>
<li>experienced Python developers hoping to dive even deeper</li>
</ul>


<p>If you saw yourself in that list and you plan to use Python heavily for at least a few more years, I highly recommend checking out <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/lifetime-access-sale/">the Python Morsels sale</a>.</p>

<p>From now through November 27, you can get <strong>lifetime access</strong> to Python Morsels for a one-time fee.
Python Morsels usually costs <strong>$240/year</strong> but lifetime access is <strong>only $480</strong>.
This is the best sale I&rsquo;ve ever offered on Python Morsels and I&rsquo;m guessing this might be the best Python-related deal this year.</p>

</ul>


<h2>Python learning subscriptions</h2>

<p>I use a subscription model for <a href="https://trey.io/cyber-monday-sale-2022">Python Morsels</a> because subscriptions (when done well) can encourage habitual learning, which is often more effective than binge-learning.
But Python Morsels isn&rsquo;t the only subscription-based Python learning platform.</p>

<p>Here sales on other learning subscriptions:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/online-learning/cyber-monday-2022.html">O'Reilly Media</a></strong> subscriptions are $200 off with the coupon <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/online-learning/cyber-monday-2022.html">CYBERWEEK22</a></li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.datacamp.com/promo/black-friday-2022">DataCamp</a></strong> has a 50% off sale on their annual subscriptions right now as well</li>
</ul>


<p>Also here&rsquo;s a Python-related service that&rsquo;s on sale (a subscription product, not a learning service):</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sourcery</strong>: <a href="https://sourcery.ai/pricing/">Sourcery Pro</a> is 33% off for the first 12 months with coupon <code>BLACKFRIDAY2022</code></li>
</ul>

<h3>50% off dozens of Python screencasts (Python Morsels)</h3>

<h3>Lots of screencasts, exercises, books, and courses on sale</h3>

<p>This blog post is not up-to-date yet.
<strong>Check back on Black Friday</strong> for more Python-related sales as I hear about them (and feel free to comment below if you find more).</p>

<p>Also don&rsquo;t go too wild on sales!
If you don&rsquo;t have time to work through a Python course, don&rsquo;t buy it.
If you&rsquo;re unlikely to ever read that Python book, don&rsquo;t get it.
And if you can&rsquo;t commit to weekly Python learning, don&rsquo;t subscribe!</p>

<p>Consider picking a few things that look like you&rsquo;ll actually use them, and buy them.
Python educators love your support, but we also like happy customers who use and love our services.</p>

<p>Also if you have money to spend but nothing to spend it on (that&rsquo;s a great problem to have&hellip;), do as Python educator <a href="https://twitter.com/AllenDowney/status/1462856493716459526">Allen Downey suggested</a> and <strong>donate to charity</strong>.
You could <a href="https://psfmember.org/">become a PSF member</a> or give to highly effective charities via <a href="https://www.givewell.org/">GiveWell</a> or <a href="https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/">The Life You Can Save</a>.</p>

<p>If you have a question about <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/watch-python-screencasts/">the Python Morsels sale</a> please <a href='m&amp;#97;&amp;#105;l&amp;#116;o&amp;#58;he&amp;#108;p&amp;#64;&amp;#112;%7&amp;#57;th%6Fnmo&amp;#114;s%6&amp;#53;ls&amp;#46;&amp;#99;&amp;#111;m'>email me</a>.

<p>No Starch Press is also running <a href="https://nostarch.com/catalog/python">a 33% off sale</a> on their Python books (with books by Al Sweigart, Eric Matthes, and many others), though the sale ends before Monday.</p>

<h3>Real Python subscription</h3>

<p>Real Python is offering an annual subscription for <a href="https://realpython.com/account/join/?c=blackfriday2020">$200/year</a> and 20% of that goes to the Python Software Foundation.</p>

<h3>Pluralsight subscription</h3>

<p>We&rsquo;re now moving into &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really not actually sure what you&rsquo;re getting&rdquo; sales.
Pluralsight is running a Black Friday sale this year: <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/offer/2020/bf-cm-40-off">$180/year for a subscription</a>.
I&rsquo;m not sure whether this is one year for $180 but the subscription renews at the regular price of $300/year or whether it&rsquo;s $180/year indefinitely (the fact that they don&rsquo;t specify is a bit concerning).</p>

<h3>100 Days of Code Python and other Udemy courses</h3>

<p>There&rsquo;s a <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/?couponCode=DCF8D1FDCAA3CE660C34">100 Days of Code Python course</a> course on sale for just $13 on Udemy through mid next week.
I haven&rsquo;t heard anything about it but it looks like it includes <em>a lot</em>.</p>

<p>There are also various other Udemy Python courses on sale, like <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/automate/">Automate The Boring Stuff</a>, though many of these sales end within the next 24 hours (through Black Friday only).</p>

<h3>Lots of courses, books, screencasts, exercises, live workshops on sale</h3>

<p>Don&rsquo;t go too wild on sales.</p>

<p>I know that I wouldn&rsquo;t want anyone subscribing to Python Morsels unless they think they&rsquo;ll actually commit at least an hour over the next year to watch screencasts.
I imagine many other Python educators feel similar about purchases that go to waste.</p>

<p>Look through the sales above and think about what you could use.
What works well with the way you learn and what would you actually make a habit to use after you&rsquo;ve purchased it?</p>

<p>If you have a question about the <a href="https://treyhunner.com/2020/11/short-python-screencasts-for-$50-slash-year/">Python Morsels screencasts/exercises</a>, email me.
If you have questions about other sales, email the folks running those sales (make sure to do it now in case they take a day or two to get back to you).</p>

<p>Also if you&rsquo;ve found other Python sales I&rsquo;ve missed above, please comment or <a href='m&amp;#97;&amp;#105;l&amp;#116;o&amp;#58;he&amp;#108;p&amp;#64;&amp;#112;%7&amp;#57;th%6Fnmo&amp;#114;s%6&amp;#53;ls&amp;#46;&amp;#99;&amp;#111;m'>email me</a> to let me know about them.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m running <a href="https://treyhunner.com/2019/11/black-friday-sale-gift-python-morsels-to-a-friend/">a sale</a> that ends in 24 hours, but I&rsquo;m not the only one.
This post is a compilation of the different Cyber Monday deals I&rsquo;ve found related to Python and Python learning.</p>

<h3>Python Morsels, weekly skill-building for professional Pythonistas</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/">Python Morsels</a> is my weekly Python skill-building service.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m offering something sort of like a &ldquo;buy one get one free&rdquo; sale this year.</p>

<p>You can pay $200 to get 2 redemption codes, each worth 12 months of Python Morsels.</p>

<p>You can use one code for yourself and give one to a friend.
Or you could be extra generous and give them both away to two friends.
Either way, 2 people are each getting one year&rsquo;s worth of weekly Python training.</p>

<p>You can find <a href="https://treyhunner.com/2019/11/black-friday-sale-gift-python-morsels-to-a-friend/">more details on this sale here</a>.</p>

<h3>Data School&rsquo;s Machine Learning course</h3>

<p>Kevin Markham of Data School is selling his &ldquo;Machine Learning with Text in Python&rdquo; course for $195 (it&rsquo;s usually $295).
You can find more details on this sale <a href="https://www.dataschool.io/black-friday/">on the Data School Black Friday post</a>.</p>

<h3>Talk Python Course Bundle</h3>

<p>Michael Kennedy is selling a bundle that includes <a href="https://training.talkpython.fm/black-friday-2019">every Talk Python course for $250</a>.</p>

<p>There are 20 courses included in this bundle.
If you&rsquo;re into Python and you don&rsquo;t already own most of these courses, this bundle could be a really good deal for you.</p>

<h3>Reuven Lerner&rsquo;s Python courses</h3>

<p>Reuven Lerner is offering a <a href="https://lerner.co.il/2019/11/28/my-black-friday-sale-is-live-take-50-off-any-course-in-python-or-data-science/">50% off sale on his courses</a>.
Reuven has courses on Python, Git, and regular expressions.</p>

<p>This sale also includes Reuven&rsquo;s <a href="https://store.lerner.co.il/wpe?coupon=BF2019">Weekly Python Exercise</a>, which is similar to <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/">Python Morsels</a>, but has its own flavor.
You could sign up for both if you want double the weekly learning.</p>
