    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you code in Python regularly, you&rsquo;re already learning new things everyday.</p>

<p>You hit a wall, or something breaks. Then you search around, spend some hours on Stack Overflow, and eventually, you figure it out.</p>

<p><strong>But this kind of learning is unstructured. It&rsquo;s reactive, instead of intentional.</strong></p>

<p>You fix the problem at hand, but the underlying gaps in your knowledge remain unaddressed.</p>

<h2>A more structured way to improve your Python skills</h2>

<p>Python Morsels gives you <strong>a structured, hands-on way to improve your Python skills</strong> through weekly practice:</p>

<ul>
<li>Notice significant progress with as little as 30 minutes a week</li>
<li>Learn to naturally think more Pythonically</li>
<li>Explore new approaches to problem-solving</li>
<li>Challenge yourself to get outside your comfort zone regularly</li>
</ul>


<p>Python Morsels is a subscription service because <strong>I&rsquo;m adding new learning resources almost every week</strong>.</p>

<p>But through December 1st, you can get <strong><a href="https://pythonmorsels.com/lifetime-access-sale/">lifetime access</a></strong> for a one-time payment.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>When you sign up for Python Morsels, you&rsquo;ll choose your current Python skill level, from novice to advanced.</p>

<p>Based on your skill level, <strong>each Monday I&rsquo;ll send you a personalized routine</strong> with:</p>

<ul>
<li>a short screencast to watch (or read)</li>
<li>a multi-part exercise to move you outside your comfort zone</li>
<li>a mini exercise that you can accomplish in just 10 minutes</li>
<li>links to dive deeper into subsequent screencasts and exercises</li>
</ul>


<p>Think of Python Morsels as a gym for your Python skills: you come in for quick training sessions, put in the reps, and make a little more progress each time.</p>

<p>All these resources are accessible to you forever, and with lifetime access you&rsquo;ll never pay another subscription fee.</p>

<h2>What Python Morsels includes</h2>

<p>Python Morsels has grown a lot over the past 8 years. Currently, Python Morsels has:</p>

<ul>
<li>235+ Video Lessons (or screencasts, as I call them)</li>
<li>262+ Hands-On Exercises (with solution walkthroughs)</li>
<li>500+ Optional Bonuses (to challenge every skill level)</li>
<li>303+ Articles Organized Topic-Wise (if you prefer reading)</li>
</ul>


<p>I&rsquo;ll be sending you personalized recommendations every week, but you can use these resources however they fit your routine: as learning guides, hands-on practice sessions, quick cheatsheets, long-term reference material, or quick Python workouts.</p>

<p>In addition to this, Python Morsels also gives you access to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Python Jumpstart - a structured course for beginners</li>
<li>Additional Deep-Dive Courses - structured tracks to master a concept</li>
<li>Exercise Paths - topic-based exercises to strengthen a specific skill</li>
</ul>


<p>Because Python Morsels runs as an active subscription service, I&rsquo;m always adding new screencasts, new exercises, and updated material on a weekly or monthly cycle. I also keep everything up-to-date with each new Python release, incorporating newly added features and retiring end-of-life&rsquo;d Python versions.</p>

<h2>Lock in lifetime access</h2>

<p>Python Morsels usually costs <strong>$240/year</strong> but you can get <strong>lifetime access</strong> through December 1st for a one-time payment. I&rsquo;ve only offered lifetime access <strong>once before</strong> in 8 years.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve been on the fence about subscribing to Python Morsels or want to invest in building a daily learning habit, this is a good time to do it.</p>

    <link href="https://treyhunner.com/2024/11/new-python-jumpstart-course/"/>
    <updated>2024-11-25T08:08:08-08:00</updated>
    <id>https://treyhunner.com/2024/11/new-python-jumpstart-course</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve just recently launched a self-paced introduction to Python that is <strong>extremely hands-on</strong>.
It&rsquo;s called <strong><a href="https://pym.dev/courses/jumpstart/overview">Python Jumpstart</a></strong> and it&rsquo;s based on introductory Python curriculum that I have been iterating on for years.</p>

<h2>Learn Python by writing Python code ✍</h2>

<p>We <em>do not</em> learn by putting information into the brain.
Our brains simply don&rsquo;t retain knowledge that way.</p>

<p>Learning happens from repeatedly attempting to retrieve information <em>from</em> the brain.
When it comes to Python, that means <strong>writing Python code</strong>.</p>

<p>So unlike most Python courses, Python Jumpstart is <em>not</em> focused on watching videos and rewriting code seen within videos.
Instead, this new Python course is based around <strong>learning Python by writing Python code</strong>.</p>

<h2>How Python Jumpstart is structured 🔬</h2>

<p>Python Jumpstart includes learning Python by solving <strong>46 short Python exercises</strong>.</p>

<p>Before each exercise, you&rsquo;ll watch a 5 minute video explaining a new Python topic.
You&rsquo;ll then attempt the exercise to put one or more Python topics into practice.</p>

<p>You won&rsquo;t solve many of the exercises on your first try and <em>that&rsquo;s okay</em>.
These exercises are designed to be revisited a few times over the course of weeks, until you&rsquo;re satisfied with your solution.</p>

<h2>This is not a sprint 📆</h2>

<p>This structured path to Python proficiency, includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Carefully crafted exercises that build real understanding</li>
<li>Short, detailed explanations that <em>won&rsquo;t</em> waste your time</li>
<li>A proven teaching approach that focuses on active learning</li>
<li>Spaced repetition to help concepts stick</li>
</ul>


<p>This is not a course for impatient or passive learners.
Learning takes <strong>repetitive effort</strong> spaced over many days and this course is structured to embrace that fact.</p>

<p>If you spend <strong>30 minutes</strong> on Python Jumpstart each day, I estimate that you&rsquo;ll complete this course in <strong>about 7 weeks</strong>.
You&rsquo;ll spend the large majority of that time writing Python code.</p>

<p>This course <em>will</em> take time, but it will be time well-spent.</p>

<h2>Launch week special: 50% off until December 2 ⏰</h2>

<p>Through Monday December 2, 2024, you can get lifetime access to <a href="https://pym.dev/courses/jumpstart/overview">Python Jumpstart</a> for <strong>$99</strong>.
After this launch week, Python Jumpstart will be <strong>$199</strong>.</p>

<p>If you know of another sale (or a likely sale) <strong>please comment below</strong>.</p>

<h2>Django sales</h2>

<p>Adam Johnson is also compiling many <strong>Django-related Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales</strong> via a <a href="https://adamj.eu/tech/2023/11/20/django-black-friday-deals-2023/">Django sales post</a>.</p>

<h2>More developer-oriented deals</h2>

<p>For even more Black Friday deals for software developers, see <a href="https://blackfridaydeals.dev">BlackFridayDeals.dev</a>, which I believe launched this year.</p>

<h2>Go get yourself some deals!</h2>

<p>Go hop on those sales! (But make sure to put an event in your calendar to actually use what you purchase. 😉)
And if you have questions about the <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/lifetime-access-sale/"><strong>Python Morsels Cyber Monday sale</strong></a> please comment below or <a href="mailto:he&amp;#108;p&amp;#64;&amp;#112;%7&amp;#57;th%6Fnmo&amp;#114;s%6&amp;#53;ls&amp;#46;&amp;#99;&amp;#111;m">email me</a>.</p>
