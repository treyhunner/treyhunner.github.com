    <updated>2024-11-25T08:08:08-08:00</updated>
    <id>https://treyhunner.com/2024/11/new-python-jumpstart-course</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve just recently launched a self-paced introduction to Python that is <strong>extremely hands-on</strong>.
It&rsquo;s called <strong><a href="https://pym.dev/courses/jumpstart/overview">Python Jumpstart</a></strong> and it&rsquo;s based on introductory Python curriculum that I have been iterating on for years.</p>

<h2>Learn Python by writing Python code ‚úç</h2>

<p>We <em>do not</em> learn by putting information into the brain.
Our brains simply don&rsquo;t retain knowledge that way.</p>

<p>Learning happens from repeatedly attempting to retrieve information <em>from</em> the brain.
When it comes to Python, that means <strong>writing Python code</strong>.</p>

<p>So unlike most Python courses, Python Jumpstart is <em>not</em> focused on watching videos and rewriting code seen within videos.
Instead, this new Python course is based around <strong>learning Python by writing Python code</strong>.</p>

<h2>How Python Jumpstart is structured üî¨</h2>

<p>Python Jumpstart includes learning Python by solving <strong>46 short Python exercises</strong>.</p>

<p>Before each exercise, you&rsquo;ll watch a 5 minute video explaining a new Python topic.
You&rsquo;ll then attempt the exercise to put one or more Python topics into practice.</p>

<p>You won&rsquo;t solve many of the exercises on your first try and <em>that&rsquo;s okay</em>.
These exercises are designed to be revisited a few times over the course of weeks, until you&rsquo;re satisfied with your solution.</p>

<h2>This is not a sprint üìÜ</h2>

<p>This structured path to Python proficiency, includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Carefully crafted exercises that build real understanding</li>
<li>Short, detailed explanations that <em>won&rsquo;t</em> waste your time</li>
<li>A proven teaching approach that focuses on active learning</li>
<li>Spaced repetition to help concepts stick</li>
</ul>


<p>This is not a course for impatient or passive learners.
Learning takes <strong>repetitive effort</strong> spaced over many days and this course is structured to embrace that fact.</p>

<p>If you spend <strong>30 minutes</strong> on Python Jumpstart each day, I estimate that you&rsquo;ll complete this course in <strong>about 7 weeks</strong>.
You&rsquo;ll spend the large majority of that time writing Python code.</p>

<p>This course <em>will</em> take time, but it will be time well-spent.</p>

<h2>Launch week special: 50% off until December 2 ‚è∞</h2>

<p>Through Monday December 2, 2024, you can get lifetime access to <a href="https://pym.dev/courses/jumpstart/overview">Python Jumpstart</a> for <strong>$99</strong>.
After this launch week, Python Jumpstart will be <strong>$199</strong>.</p>

</ul>


<h2>Python learning subscriptions</h2>

<p>I use a subscription model for <a href="https://trey.io/cyber-monday-sale-2022">Python Morsels</a> because subscriptions (when done well) can encourage habitual learning, which is often more effective than binge-learning.
But Python Morsels isn&rsquo;t the only subscription-based Python learning platform.</p>

<p>Here sales on other learning subscriptions:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/online-learning/cyber-monday-2022.html">O'Reilly Media</a></strong> subscriptions are $200 off with the coupon <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/online-learning/cyber-monday-2022.html">CYBERWEEK22</a></li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.datacamp.com/promo/black-friday-2022">DataCamp</a></strong> has a 50% off sale on their annual subscriptions right now as well</li>
</ul>


<p>Also here&rsquo;s a Python-related service that&rsquo;s on sale (a subscription product, not a learning service):</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sourcery</strong>: <a href="https://sourcery.ai/pricing/">Sourcery Pro</a> is 33% off for the first 12 months with coupon <code>BLACKFRIDAY2022</code></li>
</ul>


<h2>Django sales</h2>

<p>Adam Johnson compiled many <a href="https://adamj.eu/tech/2022/11/21/django-black-friday-deals-2022/"><strong>Django-related Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a quick summary:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is my annual compilation post of Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals I&rsquo;ve found related to <strong>Python and Python learning</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Some sales likely aren&rsquo;t announced yet, so I will update this post on Black Friday and Cyber Monday.</p>

<h3>50% off dozens of Python screencasts (Python Morsels)</h3>

<p>Yes, the self-promotion comes first.</p>

<p>The Python Morsels Lite plan has evolved <em>a lot</em> since I first launched it and it&rsquo;s long overdue for a price increase.
This plan includes access to <strong>over 90 Python screencasts</strong> (a new one added each week) as well as a <strong>monthly Python exercise</strong> (your choice from novice to advanced Python).</p>

<p>From December 1, 2021 onward the price for the Python Morsels Lite plan will be $10/month or $100/year.
Until November 30, you can signup for <strong>$5/month</strong> or <strong>$50/year</strong> (and you&rsquo;ll lock-in that price for as long as you&rsquo;re subscribed).
This is the lowest price I&rsquo;ll ever offer this plan for.</p>

<p><strong>Save 50%</strong> on <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/watch-python-screencasts/">the Python Morsels Lite plan</a> by signing up from now until Cyber Monday.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/watch-python-screencasts/">Get the Python Morsels Lite plan for just $50/year</a></p>

<h3>Reuven Lerner&rsquo;s Python courses and Weekly Python Exercise</h3>

<p>Reuven Lerner is offering <a href="https://store.lerner.co.il/?coupon=BF2021">30% off all his products</a> (intro Python bundle, advanced Python bundle, data analytics bundle, and Weekly Python Exercises, and more) through Monday.
Enter the coupon BF2021 if needed (though that link should apply the coupon already).</p>

<p>If you like Python Morsels, you might want to check out Reuven&rsquo;s Weekly Python exercise as well.
Both are based around exercise-driven learning.</p>

<h3>Matt Harrison&rsquo;s books and courses on Python, data science, and Pandas</h3>

<p>Matt Harrison is offering a 40% discount on all his courses and books (on Python, Pandas, and data science).
See his <a href="https://store.metasnake.com/?coupon=BF40">MetaSnake store</a> for more details.

<strong>Check back on Black Friday</strong> for more Python-related sales as I hear about them (and feel free to comment below if you find more).</p>

<p>Also don&rsquo;t go too wild on sales!
If you don&rsquo;t have time to work through a Python course, don&rsquo;t buy it.
If you&rsquo;re unlikely to ever read that Python book, don&rsquo;t get it.
And if you can&rsquo;t commit to weekly Python learning, don&rsquo;t subscribe!</p>

<p>Consider picking a few things that look like you&rsquo;ll actually use them, and buy them.
Python educators love your support, but we also like happy customers who use and love our services.</p>

<p>Also if you have money to spend but nothing to spend it on (that&rsquo;s a great problem to have&hellip;), do as Python educator <a href="https://twitter.com/AllenDowney/status/1462856493716459526">Allen Downey suggested</a> and <strong>donate to charity</strong>.
You could <a href="https://psfmember.org/">become a PSF member</a> or give to highly effective charities via <a href="https://www.givewell.org/">GiveWell</a> or <a href="https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/">The Life You Can Save</a>.</p>

<p>If you have a question about <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/watch-python-screencasts/">the Python Morsels sale</a> please <a href='m&amp;#97;&amp;#105;l&amp;#116;o&amp;#58;he&amp;#108;p&amp;#64;&amp;#112;%7&amp;#57;th%6Fnmo&amp;#114;s%6&amp;#53;ls&amp;#46;&amp;#99;&amp;#111;m'>email me</a>.
