    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I traveled back home from PyCon US 2024 last week.
This is my reflection on my time at PyCon.</p>

<h2>Attempting to eat vegan</h2>

<p>Since 2020, I&rsquo;ve been <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/111794737871397453">gradually eating more plant-based</a> and <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/111982459215543497">a few months ago</a> I decided to take PyCon as an opportunity to attempt exclusively vegan eating outside my own home.
As <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/112493037289419028">I noted on Mastodon</a>, it was a challenge and I failed every day at least once but I found the experience worthwhile.
Our food system is <em>very</em> dairy-oriented.</p>

<h2>Staying hydrated and fed</h2>

<p>One of the first things I did before heading to the convention center was walk to Target and buy snacks and drinks.
When at PyCon, I prefer to spend 30 minutes and $20 to have a backup plan for last minute hydration and calories (even if not the <em>greatest</em> calories).
I never quite know when I might sleep through breakfast, find lunch lacking, or wish I&rsquo;d eaten more dinner.</p>

<h2>A tutorial, an orientation, a lightning talk, and open spaces</h2>

<p>My responsibilities at PyCon this year included teaching a tutorial and helping run the Newcomer&rsquo;s Orientation with <a href="https://x.com/KojoIdrissa">Kojo</a> and <a href="https://social.coop/@brainwane">Sumana</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/112479031063220835">Yngve and Marie</a> offered to act as teaching assistants during my tutorial and I was very grateful for their help!
<a href="https://x.com/mathsppblog">Rodrigo</a> and Krishna also offered to TA just before my tutorial started and I was extra grateful to have even more help than I&rsquo;d expected.
The attendees were mostly better prepared than I expected they would be, which was also great.
It&rsquo;s always great to spend less time on setup and more time exploring Python together.</p>

<p>The newcomer&rsquo;s orientation the next day went well.
We kept it fairly brief and were able to address about 10 minutes of audience questions before the opening reception started.</p>

<p>Once my PyCon responsibilities completed, I invented a few more (light) responsibilities for myself. 😅
I signed up to give a lightning talk on how to give a lightning talk.
They slotted it as the first talk of the first lightning talk session on Friday night.
I kept this talk pretty much the same as the one <a href="https://youtu.be/aNHBr7q-KVw?feature=shared&amp;t=915">I presented DjangoCon 2016</a>.
I could have made the transitions fancier, but I decided to embrace the idea of simplicity with the hope that audience members might think &ldquo;look if that first speaker can give such a simple and succinct presentation, maybe I can too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On Saturday I ran <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/112457077109815019">an open space on Python Learning</a>.
Some of you showed up because you&rsquo;re on my mailing list or you&rsquo;re paying Python Morsels subscribers.
Many folks showed up because the topic was interesting, either as a learner or as a teacher.
I really enjoyed the round-table-style conversation we had.</p>

<p>I also ran a <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/112468136603503893">Cabo Card game open space</a> during lunch on Sunday on the 4th floor rooftop.
Cabo is my usual conference ice breaker game and I played it at least a few nights <a href="https://mas.to/@davidism/112465501797531611">in The Westin lobby</a> as well.</p>

<h2>Seeing conference friends, old and new</h2>

<p>For me, PyCon is largely about having conversations.
The talks and tutorials are great for starting me thinking about an idea.
The hallway track, open spaces, and meals are great for continuing conversations about those ideas (or <em>other</em> ideas).</p>

<p>My first morning in Pittsburgh, I chatted with Naomi Ceder and Reuven Lerner.
I&rsquo;m glad I ran into them before the conference kicked off because (as often happens at PyCon) I only very briefly saw either of them during the rest of PyCon!</p>

<p>After my tutorial that afternoon, I did dinner with Marie, Yngve, and Rodrigo at Rosewater Mediterranean (good vegan options, assuming you enjoy falafel and various sauces).
As sometimes happens at PyCon, another PyCon attendee, Sachin, joined our table because we noticed him eating on his own at a table near us and invited him to join us.</p>

<p>On Saturday, <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@melaniearbor">Melanie</a>, <a href="https://mas.to/@davidism">David</a>, <a href="https://x.com/kjaymiller">Jay</a>, and I had a sort of mini San Diego Python study group reunion dinner before inviting folks to join us for <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/112465503888730383">Cabo and Knucklebones</a> one night.
The 4 of us originally met each other (along with <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@willingc">Carol</a> and other wonderful Python folks) at the San Diego Python study group about 10 years ago.</p>

<p>I had some wonderful conversations about ways to improve the Python documentation over dinner (at Nicky&rsquo;s Thai) on Sunday night with <em>so</em> many docs-concerned folks who I highly respect.
I&rsquo;m really excited that Python has <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0732/">the documentation editorial board</a> and I&rsquo;m hopeful that that board, with the help of many others community members, will usher in big improvements to the documentation in the coming years.</p>

<p>I also met a number of Internet acquaintances IRL for the first time at PyCon.
I met <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tereza-iofciu/">Tereza</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessica0greene/">Jessica</a>, who I know from our work in the PSF Code of Conduct workgroup.
I met <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@slott56">Steve Lott</a>, who I originally knew as <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/10661/s-lott">a prolific question-answerer</a>.
I also met <a href="https://github.com/hugovk">Hugo</a>, a CPython core dev, the Python 3.14 &amp; 3.15 release manager, and a <a href="https://mastodon.social/@hugovk">social media user</a> (which is how I&rsquo;ve primarily interacted with him because the Internet is occasionally lovely).
I was also very excited to meet many <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com">Python Morsels members</a> as well as folks who know me through <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/newsletter/">my weekly Python tips newsletter</a>.</p>

<p>I was grateful to chat with <a href="https://mastodon.social/@hynek">Hynek</a> and <a href="https://mastodon.social/@AlSweigart">Al</a> about creating talks, YouTube videos, and other online content.
I also enjoyed chatting with <a href="https://mastodon.social/@glyph">Glyph</a> a bit about our experiences consulting and training and (in hindsight) wished I&rsquo;d planned an open space for either consultants or trainers, both of which have been held at PyCon before but it just takes someone to stick it on the open space board.</p>

<p>Many folks I only saw very briefly (I said a quick hi and bye to <a href="https://aeracode.org/@andrew">Andrew</a> over lunch during the sprints) and some I didn&rsquo;t see at all (<a href="https://mastodon.social/@frank@frankwiles.social">Frank</a> was at PyCon but we never ran into each other).
Some I essentially saw through playing a few rounds of Cabo (<a href="https://social.coop/@Yhg1s">Thomas</a> and <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@ethantyping">Ethan</a> among many others).
We also ran into at least 4 other PyCon attendees in the airport on Tuesday afternoon, including <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bbelderbos/">Bob</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliansequeira/">Julian</a>, who it&rsquo;s always a pleasure to see.</p>

<h2>A Mastodon-oriented PyCon</h2>

<p>On Thursday night I had the feeling that the number of Mastodon posts I saw on the <strong>#PyConUS</strong> hashtag was greater than the number of Twitter posts.
I (very unscientifically) counted up the number of posts I was seeing on each and found that my perception was correct: <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/112453920848761679">Mastodon seemed to slightly overtake Twitter at PyCon this year</a>.</p>

<p>Over dinner on Wednesday, I tried to convince Marie, Yngve, and Rodrigo to get Mastodon accounts just to follow the hashtag during PyCon.
I succeeded: <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/112479031063220835">Marie and Yngve</a> and <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@davep/112458736212760528">Rodrigo</a>!</p>

<p>Mastodon will never be <em>the</em> social media platform.
Its decentralized nature is too much of a barrier for many folks.
However, it does seem to be used by <em>enough</em> somewhat nerdy Python folks to now be one the most used social media platform for PyCon posting.</p>

<h2>The talks</h2>

<p>I ended up spending little time in the talks during PyCon.
This wasn&rsquo;t on purpose.
I just happened to attend many open spaces, take personal breaks, and end up in hallway conversations often.
I did see many of the lightning talks live, as well as Jay, Simon, and Sumana&rsquo;s keynotes (all of them were exceptional) and the opening and closing remarks.
I also watched a few talks from my hotel room while taking breaks.</p>

<p>While I&rsquo;m often a bit light on my talk load at PyCon, I do recommend folks attend a good handful of live talks during PyCon, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@jonafato/112514979873634457">as Jon</a> and <a href="https://hynek.me/articles/hallway-track/">others</a> recommend.
I wish I had seen more talks live.
I also wish I had attended a few open spaces that I missed.</p>

<p>At any one time, I know that I&rsquo;m always missing about 90% of what&rsquo;s scheduled during PyCon (if you include the talks <em>and</em> the open spaces).
That&rsquo;s assuming I don&rsquo;t ditch the conference entirely for a few hours and <a href="https://social.coop/@bitprophet/112452662184950234">walk across a bridge</a> or <a href="https://mastodon.social/@AlSweigart/112514009252817862">ride a funicular</a> (neither of which I did, as I stuck around the venue the whole time this year).
I am glad I saw, did, and talked about everything I did, but there&rsquo;s always something I wish I&rsquo;d seen/done!</p>

<h2>The sprints</h2>

<p>Thanks to the documentation dinner, I had a couple documentation-related ideas in mind on the first day of sprints.
But I&rsquo;m also <em>really</em> excited about the new Python REPL coming in Python 3.13 (<a href="https://x.com/treyhunner/status/1720185049461801371">in case</a> you <a href="https://treyhunner.com/2024/05/installing-a-custom-python-build-with-pyenv/">can&rsquo;t tell</a> from <a href="https://treyhunner.com/2024/05/my-favorite-python-3-dot-13-feature/">how much</a> I <a href="https://x.com/treyhunner/status/1788307498715554160">talk</a> about <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/treyhunner_python-activity-7194082747315859456-qQjk/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">it</a>), so I sprinted on that instead.
<a href="https://github.com/ambv">Łukasz</a> assigned me the task of researching keyboard shortcuts that the new REPL is missing (compared to the current one on Linux and Mac) so <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/119034#issuecomment-2121142576">I spent some time researching that</a>.
I got to see the REPL running on <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@tonybaloney/112477098396842900">Anthony&rsquo;s laptop</a> on Windows and I am <em>so excited</em> that Windows support will be included before 3.13.0 lands! 🎉</p>

<p>Partly inspired by <a href="https://youtu.be/RL3HFj5SDqI?t=1549">Carol Willing&rsquo;s PyCon preview message</a>, I also thanked <a href="https://github.com/pablogsal">Pablo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ambv">Łukasz</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/lysnikolaou">Lysandros</a> in-person for all their work on the new Python REPL. 🤗</p>

<h2>Until next year</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be <a href="https://www.pyohio.org/2024/program/speakers/keynote-speakers/#trey-hunner">keynoting at PyOhio</a> this year.</p>

<p>Besides PyOhio, I&rsquo;m not sure whether I&rsquo;ll make it to another conference until PyCon US next year.
I&rsquo;d love to attend all of them, but I do have work and personal goals that need accomplishing too!</p>

<p>I hope to see you at PyCon US 2025!
In the meantime, if you&rsquo;re wishing we&rsquo;d exchanged contact details or met in-person, please feel free to stay in touch through <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner">Mastodon</a>, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://pym.dev/newsletter">my weekly emails</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PythonMorsels">YouTube</a>, or <a href="http://twitter.com/treyhunner">Twitter</a>.</p>

    <link href="https://treyhunner.com/2024/05/my-favorite-python-3-dot-13-feature/"/>
    <updated>2024-05-08T13:30:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>https://treyhunner.com/2024/05/my-favorite-python-3-dot-13-feature</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Python 3.13 just hit feature freeze with <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3130b1/">the first beta release today</a>.</p>

<p>Just before the feature freeze, a shiny new feature was added: <strong>a brand new Python REPL</strong>. ✨</p>

<p>This new Python REPL is the feature I&rsquo;m most looking forward to using while teaching after 3.13.0 final is released later this year.
In terms of improving my quality of life while teaching Python, this new REPL may be my favorite feature since f-strings were added in Python 3.6.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to share what&rsquo;s so great about this new REPL and what additional improvements I&rsquo;m hoping we might see in future Python releases.</p>

<p>None of these features will be ground breaking for folks who are already using <a href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython">IPython</a> day-to-day.
This new REPL really shines when you can&rsquo;t or shouldn&rsquo;t install PyPI packages (as when teaching a brand new Pythonistas in a locked-down corporate environment).</p>

<h2>Little niceties</h2>

<p>The first thing you&rsquo;ll notice when you launch the new REPL is the colored prompt.</p>

<p><img src="/images/new-repl-intro.gif"></p>

<p>You may also notice that as you type a block of code, after the first indented line, the next line will be auto-indented!
Additionally, hitting the Tab key inserts 4 spaces now, which means there&rsquo;s no more need to ever hit <code>Space Space Space Space</code> to indent ever again.</p>

<p>At this point you might be thinking, &ldquo;wait did I accidentally launch ptpython or some other alternate REPL?&rdquo;
But it gets even better!</p>

<h2>You can &ldquo;exit&rdquo; now</h2>

<p>Have you ever typed <code>exit</code> at the Python REPL?
If so, you&rsquo;ve seen a message like this:</p>

<pre><code class="pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; exit
Use exit() or Ctrl-D (i.e. EOF) to exit
</code></pre>

<p>That feels a bit silly, doesn&rsquo;t it?
Well, typing <code>exit</code> will exit immediately.</p>

<p><img src="/images/new-repl-exit.gif"></p>

<p>Typing <code>help</code> also enters help mode now (previously you needed to call <code>help()</code> as a function).</p>

<h2>Block-level history</h2>

<p>The feature that will make the biggest different in my own usage of the Python REPL is block-level history.</p>

<p><img src="/images/new-repl-block.gif"></p>

<p>I make typos all the time while teaching.
I also often want to re-run a specific block of code with a couple small changes.</p>

<p>The old-style Python REPL stores history line-by-line.
So editing a block of code in the old REPL required hitting the up arrow many times, hitting Enter, hitting the up arrow many more times, hitting Enter, etc. until each line in a block was chosen.
At the same time you also needed to make sure to edit your changes along the way&hellip; or you&rsquo;ll end up re-running the same block with the same typo as before!</p>

<p>The ability to edit a previously typed <em>block</em> of code is huge for me.
For certain sections of my Python curriculum, I hop into <a href="https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/ptpython">ptpython</a> or <a href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython">IPython</a> specifically for this feature.
Now I&rsquo;ll be able to use the default Python REPL instead.</p>

<h2>Pasting code <em>just works</em></h2>

<p>The next big feature for me is the ability to paste code.</p>

<p>Check this out:</p>

<p><img src="/images/new-repl-paste.gif"></p>

<p>Not impressed?
Well, watch what happens when we paste that same block of code into the old Python REPL:</p>

<p><img src="/images/old-repl-paste.gif"></p>

<p>The old REPL treated pasted text the same as manually typed text.
When two consecutive newlines were encountered in the old REPL, it would end the current block of code because it assumed the Enter key had been pressed twice.</p>

<p>The new REPL supports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracketed-paste">bracketed paste</a>, which is was invented in 2002 and has since been adopted by all modern terminal emulators.</p>

<h2>No Windows support? Curses!</h2>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: This whole section is now irrelevant!
During the PyCon US sprints in late May 2024, the <code>readline</code> and <code>curses</code> dependencies were removed and <a href="https://mastodon.social/@tonybaloney@fosstodon.org/112477098540793635">Windows support</a> will be included in the second beta release of Python 3.13.0! 🎉</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this new REPL <strike>doesn&rsquo;t currently work on Windows</strike>.
This new REPL relies on the <code>curses</code> and <code>readline</code> modules, neither of which are available on Windows.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://pym.dev/repl">in-browser Python REPL</a> on Python Morsels also won&rsquo;t be able to use the new REPL because readline and curses aren&rsquo;t available in the WebAssembly Python build.</p>

<h2>Beta test Python 3.13 to try out the new REPL 💖</h2>

<p>Huge thanks to Pablo Galindo Salgado, Łukasz Langa, and Lysandros Nikolaou <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/whatsnew/3.13.html">for implementing this new feature</a>!
And thanks to Michael Hudson-Doyle and Armin Rigo for implementing the original version of this REPL, which was <a href="https://github.com/pypy/pyrepl">heavily borrowed from PyPy&rsquo;s pyrepl project</a>.</p>

<p>The new Python REPL coming in 3.13 is a major improvement over the old REPL.</p>

<p>Want to try out this new REPL?
Download and install <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3130b1/">Python 3.13.0 beta 1</a>!</p>

<p>Beta testing new Python releases helps the Python core team ensure the final release of 3.13.0 is as stable and functional as possible.
If you notice a bug, <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues">check the issue tracker</a> to see if it&rsquo;s been reported yet and if not report it!</p>

    <link href="https://treyhunner.com/2024/05/installing-a-custom-python-build-with-pyenv/"/>
    <updated>2024-05-03T21:26:23-07:00</updated>
    <id>https://treyhunner.com/2024/05/installing-a-custom-python-build-with-pyenv</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am <em>so</em> excited about the new Python REPL that will <em>likely</em> land in Python 3.13.
I&rsquo;ve been following <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/111567">this CPython pull request</a> since I heard <a href="https://github.com/pablogsal">Pablo</a> and <a href="https://lukasz.langa.pl">Łukasz</a> announce their work on the new Python REPL <a href="https://twitter.com/treyhunner/status/1720186574032531780">in episode 1</a> of their new <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/core-py/id1712665877">core.py podcast</a>.</p>

<h2>Github notifications? 🤔</h2>

<p>That pull request was quiet for many months, but in the last couple weeks, I started seeing email notifications in my inbox about it.
I&rsquo;ve never fancied myself a competent C developer and I try to steer clear from understanding TTY magic, so I have <em>no idea</em> what most of the commits do.
But seeing activity on this pull request rejuvenated my excitement about this upcoming feature!</p>

<p>I also remember reading that the Python 3.13 feature freeze is coming up soon, so I&rsquo;ve been silently cheering for that PR to make the cut before the deadline.</p>

<p>In the last few days, I decided that I should try committing to use this new REPL locally as my default Python environment.
When I type <code>python</code> on my machine, I want to live in this new shiny REPL.
I figure this will make it easier to spot bugs that might not have been noticed yet&hellip; though honestly it&rsquo;ll mostly just allow me to try out this fancy new REPL first-hand.</p>

<h2>Installing a custom CPython build in pyenv</h2>

<p>I use pyenv to manage the many Python versions I have installed on my machine.
I wondered whether it was possible to install a custom build of CPython with pyenv.</p>

<p>Instead of going to the pyenv documentation to figure out an answer, I argued with an AI until it gave me a working answer.
I tried a few AI systems at first, but Claude seemed to give me the most promising-looking answer so it was the one I argued with for 5-10 minutes until I got a working solution.</p>

<p>First, I created this <code>~/.pyenv/plugins/python-build/share/python-build/3.13.0-pyrepl</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>prefer_openssl11
export PYTHON_BUILD_CONFIGURE_WITH_OPENSSL=1
install_package "pyrepl" "https://github.com/pablogsal/cpython/archive/pyrepl.tar.gz" standard verify_py39 ensurepip
</code></pre>

<p>Then I ran this command, which took a couple minutes:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ pyenv install 3.13.0-pyrepl
</code></pre>

<p>After that, <code>pyenv versions</code> showed a new <code>3.13.0-pyrepl</code> version:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ pyenv versions
  system
* 3.8.18 (set by /home/trey/.pyenv/version)
* 3.9.18 (set by /home/trey/.pyenv/version)
* 3.10.13 (set by /home/trey/.pyenv/version)
* 3.11.6 (set by /home/trey/.pyenv/version)
* 3.12.0 (set by /home/trey/.pyenv/version)
  3.13.0-pyrepl
</code></pre>

<p>I then added <code>3.13.0-pyrepl</code> to the top of my <code>~/.pyenv/version</code> file to make this my <em>default</em> Python:</p>

<pre><code>3.13.0-pyrepl
3.12.0
3.11.6
3.10.13
3.9.18
3.8.18
</code></pre>

<p>And it worked!
Tying <code>python</code> showed the new colorful prompt.</p>

<p>Is is a bad idea to make this not-even-beta version of CPython the default Python on my machine?
I have no idea.
Everything&rsquo;s been fine for the last 10 hours at least&hellip; 🤷</p>

<p>If you ever need to try installing a custom CPython build with pyenv, maybe the above instructions will work.
They&rsquo;re mostly generated by a large language model that didn&rsquo;t give me a working answer until the third response&hellip; so feel free to let me know if it&rsquo;s all wrong (or all right?).</p>

<p>After this adventure, I checked my podcast feed this evening only to realize that there&rsquo;s <a href="https://mastodon.social/@ambv/112378026608575109">a new core.py episode</a> all about exactly this feature!
If you&rsquo;d like to hear some core developers nerd out about CPython development, give core.py a listen.
You don&rsquo;t need to understand how CPython development works to enjoy their enthusiasm. 💖</p>

    <updated>2024-04-27T11:45:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>https://treyhunner.com/2024/04/10-years-of-python-conferences</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>10 years and 10 days ago I flew home from my very first Python conference.</p>

<p>I left a few days into the PyCon US 2014 sprints and I remember feeling a bit like summer camp was ending.
I&rsquo;d played board games, contributed to an open source project, seen tons of talks, and met a <em>ton</em> of people.</p>

<h2>My first Python conference: PyCon US 2014</h2>

<p>PyCon 2014 was the first Python conference I attended.</p>

<p>At the start of the conference I only knew a handful of San Diegans.
I left having met many more folks.
Some of the folks I met I knew from online forums, GitHub repos, or videos
I met Kenneth Love, Baptiste Mispelon, Carl Meyer, Eric Holscher in-person, among many others.
Most folks I met I had never encountered online, but I was glad to have met in person.</p>

<p>For the most part, I had no idea who anyone was, what they did with Python, or what they might be interested in talking about.
I also had no idea what most of the various non-talk activities were.
I found out about the Education Summit and hadn&rsquo;t realized that it required pre-registration.
The open spaces are one of my favorite parts of PyCon and I didn&rsquo;t even they existed until PyCon 2015.</p>

<p>I <em>did</em> stay for a couple days of the sprints and I was grateful for that.
Most of the memorable human connections I had were during the sprints.
I helped <a href="https://pyvideo.org">PyVideo</a> upgrade their code base from Python 2 to Python 3 (this was before Will and Sheila <a href="https://pyvideo.org/pages/thanks-will-and-sheila.html">stepped down as maintainers</a>).
Will guided me through the code base and seemed grateful for the help.</p>

<p>I also got the idea to write front-end JavaScript tests for Django during the sprints and eventually <a href="https://github.com/django/deps/blob/main/final/0003-javascript-tests.rst">started that process</a> after PyCon thanks to Carl Meyer&rsquo;s guidance.</p>

<h2>Attending regional conferences and DjangoCon</h2>

<p>In fall 2014, I attended Django BarCamp at the Eventbrite office.
That was my first exposure to the idea of an &ldquo;unconference&rdquo;&hellip; which I kept in mind when I spotted the open spaces board at PyCon 2015.</p>

<p>Before coming back to Montreal for <a href="https://twitter.com/treyhunner/status/585969805796212736">PyCon 2015</a>, I emailed Harry Percival to ask if he could use a teaching assistant during his tutorial on writing tests. His reply was much more enthusiastic than I expected: &ldquo;YES YES OH GOD YES THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU TREY&rdquo;.
I was very honored to be able to help Harry, as my testing workflow was <em>heavily</em> inspired by many blog posts he&rsquo;d written about testing best practices in Django.</p>

<p>I coached at my first Django Girls event in 2015 in Ensenada and then my second at <a href="https://twitter.com/algosuna/status/641421944005378048">DjangoCon 2015</a> in Austin. I gave my first lightning talk at DjangoCon 2015, comparing modern JavaScript to Python. It was a lightning talk I had given at the San Diego JavaScript and <a href="https://www.sandiegopython.org">San Diego Python</a> meetups.</p>

<p>In 2016, I attended PyTennessee in Nashville. I remember attending a dinner of of about a dozen folks who spoke at the conference. I was grateful to get to chat with so many folks whose talks I&rsquo;d attended.</p>

<h2>Presenting talks and tutorials</h2>

<p>I presented my first conference tutorial at <a href="https://twitter.com/treyhunner/status/737069721292439552">PyCon 2016</a> in Portland and <a href="https://pyvideo.org/djangocon-us-2016/readability-counts.html">my first talk</a> at <a href="https://twitter.com/asendecka/status/756851845012844544">DjangoCon US 2016</a> in Philadelphia.
I had been presenting lightning talks every few months at my local Python and JavaScript meetups for a few years by then and I had hosted free workshops at my local meetup and paid workshops for training clients.</p>

<p>Having presented locally helped, but presenting on a big stage is always scary.</p>

<h2>Volunteering</h2>

<p>I volunteered at some of my first few conferences and found that I really enjoyed it.
I especially enjoyed running the registration desk, as you&rsquo;re often the first helpful face that people see coming into the conference.</p>

<p>During PyCon 2016, 2017, and 2018, I co-chaired the open spaces thanks to Anna Ossowski inviting me to help.
I had first attended open spaces during PyCon 2015 and I <em>loved</em> them.
Talks are great, but so are discussions!</p>

<p>I also ran for the PSF board of directors in 2016 and ended up serving on the board for a few years before stepping down.
After my board terms, I volunteered for the PSF Code of Conduct working group for about 6 years.
I didn&rsquo;t even know what the PSF <em>was</em> until PyCon 2015!</p>

<h2>A <em>lot</em> of travel&hellip; maybe too much</h2>

<p>After DjangoCon 2016, I went a bit conference-wild.
I attended <a href="https://twitter.com/treyhunner/status/829412120370565120">PyTennessee 2017</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/PythonChat/status/845052805375295488">PyCaribbean 2017</a> in Puerto Rico, <a href="https://twitter.com/loooorenanicole/status/866382369619562496">PyCon US 2017</a> in Portland, <a href="https://twitter.com/asteracode/status/893274761727361024">PyCon Australia 2017</a> in Melbourne, <a href="https://twitter.com/TobiasMcNulty/status/896570680933703681">DjangoCon 2017</a> in Spokane, <a href="https://twitter.com/treyhunner/status/916890505157468160">PyGotham 2017</a> in NYC, and <a href="https://twitter.com/treyhunner/status/937441419966296064">North Bay Python 2017</a> in Petaluma.</p>

<p>In 2018 I sponsored <a href="https://twitter.com/treyhunner/status/962862235734495232">PyTennessee</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jmwatt3/status/1023713820752183296">PyOhio</a> and spoke at both.
I passed out chocolate chip cookies at PyTennessee as a way to announce the launch of <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com">Python Morsels</a>.
I also attended <a href="https://twitter.com/treyhunner/status/996881842820272128">PyCon 2018</a> in Cleveland, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/144080672@N05/31764542868/">DjangoCon 2018</a> in San Diego, <a href="https://twitter.com/treyhunner/status/1048340952451047425">PyGotham 2018</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/nnja/status/1058589935618318336">North Bay Python 2018</a>.</p>

<p>I slowed down <em>a bit</em> in 2019, with just <a href="https://twitter.com/LaylaSells_cshs/status/1100058649227972609">PyCascades</a> (Seattle), <a href="https://twitter.com/mariatta/status/1125534406851084288">PyCon US</a> (Cleveland), <a href="https://twitter.com/juliansequeira/status/1157106403598749698">PyCon Australia</a> (Sydney), and DjangoCon US (San Diego, which is home for me).</p>

<h2>Since the pandemic</h2>

<p>Since the start of the pandemic, I&rsquo;ve attended <a href="https://twitter.com/treyhunner/status/1519724687890128899">PyCon US 2022</a>, DjangoCon 2022 in San Diego (in my city for the <em>third</em> time!) and <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/110243968672457367">PyCon US 2023</a>.
Traveling is more challenging for me than it used to be, but I hope to attend more regional conferences again soon.</p>

<p>Between client work, I&rsquo;ve been focusing less on conferences and more on blog posts (<a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/articles/">over here</a>), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PythonMorsels">screencasts</a>, my <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/newsletter/">weekly Python tips</a> emails, and (of course) on <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com">Python Morsels</a>.</p>

<h2>My journey started locally</h2>

<p>I became part of the Python community before I knew I was part of it.</p>

<p>I started using Python professionally in December 2009 and I attended my first San Diego Python meetup in March 2012.
I met the organizers, gave some lightning talks, attended Saturday study group sessions (thanks Carol Willing, Alain Domissy, and others for running these), and volunteered to help organize meetups, study groups, and workshops.</p>

<p>By 2014, I had learned from folks online and in-person and I had helped out at my local Python meetup.
I had even made a few contributions to some small Django packages I relied on heavily.</p>

<p>I was encouraged to attend PyCon 2014 by others who were attending (thanks Carol, Micah, and Paul among others).
The conference was well-worth the occasional feeling of overwhelm.</p>

<h2>We&rsquo;re all just people</h2>

<p>The biggest thing I&rsquo;ve repeatedly learned over the past decade of Python conferences is that we&rsquo;re all just people.</p>

<p>Carol Willing keynoted PyCon US 2023.
But I met Carol as a kind Python user in San Diego who started the first Python study group meetings in Pangea Bakery on Convoy Street.</p>

<p>Jay Miller will be keynoting PyCon US 2024.
But I met Jay as an attendee of the Python study group, who was enthusiastic about both learning and teaching others.</p>

<p>My partner, Melanie Arbor, keynoted DjangoCon 2022 along with Jay Miller.
When I met Melanie, she was new to Python and was very eager to both learn and help others.</p>

<p>David Lord has made a huge impact on the maintenance of Flask and other Pallets projects.
I met David as a Python study group attendee who was an enthusiastic StackOverflow contributor.</p>

<p>I learned a ton from Brandon Rhodes, Ned Batchelder, Russell Keith-Magee, and many others from online videos, forums, and open source projects before I ever met them.
But each of them are also just Python-loving people like the rest of us.
Russell gives good hugs, Ned is an organizer of his local Python meetup, and Brandon wears the same brand of shoes as me.</p>

<p>We all have people we&rsquo;ve learned from, we suffer from feelings of inadequacy, we get grumpy sometimes, and we care about the Python language and community in big and small ways.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s next for you?</h2>

<p>Will you attend a local meetup?
Or will you attend an online social event?</p>

<p>If so, consider asking the organize if you can present a 5 minute lightning talk at a future event.
As I <a href="https://youtu.be/aNHBr7q-KVw?si=Fryj6Ez4Cw7q-RAq">noted in a DjangoCon 2016 lightning talk</a>, lightning talks are a great way to connect with folks.</p>

<p>Will you attend a Python conference one day?
See <a href="https://treyhunner.com/2018/04/how-to-make-the-most-of-your-first-pycon/">having a great first PyCon</a> when/if you do.</p>

<p>Remember that we&rsquo;re all just people though.
Some may have a bit more experience (whether at speaking, contributing to open source, or something else), but we&rsquo;re just people.</p>

<h2>Lifetime Python Morsels access for the price of two years</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m kicking things off with <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/lifetime-access-sale/">my sale</a> on Python Morsels.
Python Morsels helps developers <strong>deepen their Python skills</strong> in a way that day-to-day coding simply can&rsquo;t.</p>
