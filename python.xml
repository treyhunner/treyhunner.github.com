    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you code in Python regularly, you&rsquo;re already learning new things everyday.</p>

<p>You hit a wall, or something breaks. Then you search around, spend some hours on Stack Overflow, and eventually, you figure it out.</p>

<p><strong>But this kind of learning is unstructured. It&rsquo;s reactive, instead of intentional.</strong></p>

<p>You fix the problem at hand, but the underlying gaps in your knowledge remain unaddressed.</p>

<h2>A more structured way to improve your Python skills</h2>

<p>Python Morsels gives you <strong>a structured, hands-on way to improve your Python skills</strong> through weekly practice:</p>

<ul>
<li>Notice significant progress with as little as 30 minutes a week</li>
<li>Learn to naturally think more Pythonically</li>
<li>Explore new approaches to problem-solving</li>
<li>Challenge yourself to get outside your comfort zone regularly</li>
</ul>


<p>Python Morsels is a subscription service because <strong>I&rsquo;m adding new learning resources almost every week</strong>.</p>

<p>But through December 1st, you can get <strong><a href="https://pythonmorsels.com/lifetime-access-sale/">lifetime access</a></strong> for a one-time payment.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>When you sign up for Python Morsels, you&rsquo;ll choose your current Python skill level, from novice to advanced.</p>

<p>Based on your skill level, <strong>each Monday I&rsquo;ll send you a personalized routine</strong> with:</p>

<ul>
<li>a short screencast to watch (or read)</li>
<li>a multi-part exercise to move you outside your comfort zone</li>
<li>a mini exercise that you can accomplish in just 10 minutes</li>
<li>links to dive deeper into subsequent screencasts and exercises</li>
</ul>


<p>Think of Python Morsels as a gym for your Python skills: you come in for quick training sessions, put in the reps, and make a little more progress each time.</p>

<p>All these resources are accessible to you forever, and with lifetime access you&rsquo;ll never pay another subscription fee.</p>

<h2>What Python Morsels includes</h2>

<p>Python Morsels has grown a lot over the past 8 years. Currently, Python Morsels has:</p>

<ul>
<li>235+ Video Lessons (or screencasts, as I call them)</li>
<li>262+ Hands-On Exercises (with solution walkthroughs)</li>
<li>500+ Optional Bonuses (to challenge every skill level)</li>
<li>303+ Articles Organized Topic-Wise (if you prefer reading)</li>
</ul>


<p>I&rsquo;ll be sending you personalized recommendations every week, but you can use these resources however they fit your routine: as learning guides, hands-on practice sessions, quick cheatsheets, long-term reference material, or quick Python workouts.</p>

<p>In addition to this, Python Morsels also gives you access to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Python Jumpstart - a structured course for beginners</li>
<li>Additional Deep-Dive Courses - structured tracks to master a concept</li>
<li>Exercise Paths - topic-based exercises to strengthen a specific skill</li>
</ul>


<p>Because Python Morsels runs as an active subscription service, I&rsquo;m always adding new screencasts, new exercises, and updated material on a weekly or monthly cycle. I also keep everything up-to-date with each new Python release, incorporating newly added features and retiring end-of-life&rsquo;d Python versions.</p>

<h2>Lock in lifetime access</h2>

<p>Python Morsels usually costs <strong>$240/year</strong> but you can get <strong>lifetime access</strong> through December 1st for a one-time payment. I&rsquo;ve only offered lifetime access <strong>once before</strong> in 8 years.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve been on the fence about subscribing to Python Morsels or want to invest in building a daily learning habit, this is a good time to do it.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Handy Python REPL Modifications]]></title>
    <link href="https://treyhunner.com/2025/10/handy-python-repl-modifications/"/>
    <updated>2025-10-08T19:59:20-07:00</updated>
    <id>https://treyhunner.com/2025/10/handy-python-repl-modifications</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I find myself in the Python REPL <em>a lot</em>.</p>

<p>I open up the REPL to play with an idea, to use Python as a calculator or quick and dirty text parsing tool, to record a screencast, to come up with a code example for an article, and (most importantly for me) to teach Python.
My Python courses and workshops are based largely around writing code together to guess how something works, try it out, and repeat.</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;ve written about before, you can <a href="https://treyhunner.com/2024/10/adding-keyboard-shortcuts-to-the-python-repl/">add custom keyboard shortcuts</a> to the new Python REPL (since 3.13) and <a href="https://treyhunner.com/2025/09/customizing-your-python-repl-color-scheme/">customize the REPL syntax highlighting</a> (since 3.14).
If you spend time in the Python REPL and wish it behaved a little more <strong>like your favorite editor</strong>, these tricks can come in handy.</p>

<p>I have added <strong>custom keyboard shortcuts</strong> to my REPL and other modifications to help me <strong>more quickly write and edit code in my REPL</strong>.
I&rsquo;d like to share some of the modifications that I&rsquo;ve found helpful in my own Python REPL.</p>

<h2>Creating a PYTHONSTARTUP file</h2>

<p>If you want to run Python code every time an interactive prompt (a REPL) starts, you can make a PYTHONSTARTUP file.</p>

<p>When Python launches an interactive prompt, it checks for a <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> environment variable.
If it finds one, it treats it as a filename that contains Python code and it <strong>runs all the code in that file</strong>, as if you had copy-pasted the code into the REPL.</p>

<p>So all of the modifications I have made to my Python REPL rely on this <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> variable in my <code>~/.zshenv</code> file:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">PYTHONSTARTUP</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$HOME</span>/.startup.py
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you use bash, you&rsquo;ll put that in your <code>~/.bashrc</code> file.
If you&rsquo;re on Windows <a href="https://gist.github.com/mitchmindtree/92c8e37fa80c8dddee5b94fc88d1288b">you&rsquo;ll need to set an environment variable the Windows way</a>.</p>

<p>With that variable set, I can now create a <code>~/.startup.py</code> file that has Python code in it.
That code will automatically run every time I launch a new Python REPL, whether within a virtual environment or outside of one.</p>

<h2>My REPL keyboard shortcuts</h2>

<p>The quick summary of my <em>current</em> modifications are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pressing <strong>Home</strong> moves to the <strong>first character in the code block</strong></li>
<li>Pressing <strong>End</strong> moves to the <strong>last character in the code block</strong></li>
<li>Pressing <strong>Alt+M</strong> moves to the <strong>first character</strong> on the current line</li>
<li>Pressing <strong>Shift+Tab</strong> removes <strong>common indentation</strong> from the code block</li>
<li>Pressing <strong>Alt+Up</strong> swaps the current line with <strong>the line above it</strong></li>
<li>Pressing <strong>Alt+Down</strong> swaps the current line with <strong>the line below it</strong></li>
<li>Pressing <strong>Ctrl+N</strong> inserts <strong>a specific list of numbers</strong></li>
<li>Pressing <strong>Ctrl+F</strong> inserts <strong>a specific list of strings</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>If you&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/repl-features/">my Python REPL shortcuts</a> article, you know that we can use <strong>Ctrl+A</strong> to move to the beginning of the line and <strong>Ctrl+E</strong> to move to the end of the line.
I already use those instead of the Home and End keys, so I decided to rebind Home and End to do something different.</p>

<p>The <strong>Alt+M</strong> key combination is essentially the same as <code>Alt+M</code> in Emacs or <code>^</code> in Vim. I usually prefer to move to the beginning of the non-whitespace in a line rather than to the beginning of the <em>entire</em> line.</p>

<p>The <strong>Shift+Tab</strong> functionality is basically a fancy wrapper around <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/dedent/">using <code>textwrap.dedent</code></a>: it dedents the current code block while keeping the cursor over the same character it was at before.</p>

<p>The <strong>Ctrl+N</strong> and <strong>Ctrl+F</strong> shortcuts make it easier for me to grab an example data structure to work with when teaching.</p>

<p>In addition to the above changes, I also modify my color scheme to work nicely with my Solarized Light color scheme in Vim.</p>

<h2>I created a pyrepl-hacks library for this</h2>

<p>My PYTHONSTARTUP file became so messy that I ended up creating a <a href="https://github.com/treyhunner/pyrepl-hacks">pyrepl-hacks library</a> to help me with these modifications.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/treyhunner/dotfiles/commits/main/startup.py">My PYTHONSTARTUP file</a> now looks pretty much like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>That&rsquo;s pretty short!</p>

<p>But wait&hellip; won&rsquo;t this fail unless pyrepl-hacks is installed in every virtual environment <em>and</em> installed globally for every Python version on my machine?</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s where that <code>sys.path.append</code> trick comes in handy&hellip;</p>

<h2>Wait&hellip; let&rsquo;s acknowledge the dragons 🐲</h2>

<p>At this point I&rsquo;d like to pause to note that all of this relies on using an implementation detail of Python that is deliberately undocumented because it <em>is not designed</em> to be used by end users.</p>

<p>The above code all relies on the <code>_pyrepl</code> module that was added in Python 3.13 (and optionally the <code>_colorize</code> module that was added in Python 3.14).</p>

<p>When I run a new future version of Python (for example Python 3.15) this solution may break.
I&rsquo;m willing to take that risk, as I know that I can always unset my shell&rsquo;s <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> variable or clear out my startup file.</p>

<p>So, just be aware&hellip; here be (private undocumented implementation detail) dragons.</p>

<h2>Monkey patching <code>sys.path</code> to allow importing <code>pyrepl_hacks</code></h2>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t install pyrepl-hacks <em>the usual way</em>.
Instead, I installed it in a very specific location.</p>

<p>I created a <code>~/.pyhacks</code> directory and then installed <code>pyrepl-hacks</code> <em>into</em> that directory:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>mkdir -p ~/.pyhacks
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>python -m pip install pyrepl-hacks --target ~/.pyhacks
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In order for the <code>pyrepl_hacks</code> Python package to work, it needs to available within every Python REPL I might launch.
Normally that would mean that it needs to be installed in every virtual environment that Python runs within.
This trick avoids that constraint.</p>

<p>When Python tries to import a module, it iterates through the <code>sys.path</code> directory list.
Any Python packages found <em>within</em> any of the <code>sys.path</code> directories may be imported.</p>

<p>So monkey patching <code>sys.path</code> within my PYTHONSTARTUP file allows <code>pyrepl_hacks</code> to be imported in every Python interpreter I launch:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">pathlib</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Path</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">sys</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">path</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Path</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">home</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="s">&quot;.pyhacks&quot;</span><span class="p">))</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>With those 3 lines (or something like them) placed in my PYTHONSTARTUP file, all interactive Python interpreters I launch will be able to import modules that are located in my <code>~/.pyhacks</code> directory.</p>

<h2>Creating your own custom REPL commands</h2>

<p>That&rsquo;s pretty neat.
But what if you want to invent your own REPL commands?</p>

<p>Well, the <code>bind</code> utility I&rsquo;ve created in the <code>pyrepl_hacks</code> module can be used as a decorator for that.</p>

<p>This will make Ctrl+X followed by Ctrl+R insert <code>import subprocess</code> followed by <code>subprocess.run("", shell=True)</code> with the cursor positioned in between the double quotes after it&rsquo;s all inserted:</p>

<p>You can read more about the ins and outs of the pyrepl-hacks package <a href="https://github.com/treyhunner/pyrepl-hacks#readme">in the readme file</a>.</p>

<h2>pyrepl-hacks is just a fancy wrapper</h2>

<p>The pyrepl-hacks package is really just a fancy wrapper around Python&rsquo;s <code>_pyrepl</code> and <code>_colorize</code> modules.</p>

<p>Why did I make a whole package and then modify my <code>sys.path</code> to use it, when I could have just used <code>_pyrepl</code> directly?</p>

<p>Three reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>To make creating new commands <em>a bit</em> easier (functions can be used instead of classes)</li>
<li>To make the key bindings look a bit nicer (I prefer <code>"Ctrl+M"</code> over <code>r"\C-M"</code>)</li>
<li>To hide my hairy hacks behind a shiny API ✨</li>
</ol>


<p>Before I made pyrepl-hacks, I implemented these commands directly within my PYTHONSTARTUP file by reaching into the internals of <code>_pyrepl</code> directly.</p>

<p>My PYTHONSTARTUP file before pyrepl-hacks was <a href="https://pym.dev/p/35q9e/">over 100 lines longer</a>.</p>

<h2>Try pyrepl-hacks and leave feedback</h2>

<p>My hope is that the <a href="https://github.com/treyhunner/pyrepl-hacks">pyrepl-hacks</a> library will be obsolete one day.
Eventually the <code>_pyrepl</code> module might be renamed to <code>pyrepl</code> (or maybe just <code>repl</code>?) and it will have a well-documented friendly-ish public interface.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I plan to maintain pyrepl-hacks.
As Python 3.15 is developed, I&rsquo;ll make sure it continues to work.
And I may add more useful commands if I think of any.</p>

<p>If you hack your own REPL, I&rsquo;d love to hear what modifications you come up with.
And if you have thoughts on how to improve pyrepl-hacks, please open an issue or get in touch.</p>

<p>Also, <strong>if you use Windows</strong>, <a href="https://github.com/treyhunner/pyrepl-hacks/issues/1">please help me</a> confirm <strong>whether certain keys work on Windows</strong>. Thanks!</p>

<p>Contributions and ideas welcome!</p>

    <link href="https://treyhunner.com/2025/09/customizing-your-python-repl-color-scheme/"/>
    <updated>2025-09-04T14:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>https://treyhunner.com/2025/09/customizing-your-python-repl-color-scheme</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Did you know that Python 3.14 will include <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#whatsnew314-pyrepl-highlighting">syntax highlighting</a> in the REPL?</p>

<p>Python 3.14 is due to be <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0745/">officially released</a> in about a month.
I recommended tweaking your Python setup now so you&rsquo;ll have your ideal color scheme on release day.</p>

<p><img src="https://treyhunner.com/images/python3.14-repl-syntax-highlighting.png" title="Python 3.14 REPL with syntax highlighting using custom color scheme" ></p>

<p>But&hellip; what if the default syntax colors don&rsquo;t match the colors that your text editor uses?</p>

<p>Well, fortunately you can customize your color scheme!</p>

<p><strong>Warning</strong>: I am recommending using an undocumented private module (it has an <code>_</code>-prefixed name) which may change in future Python versions.
Do not use this module in production code.</p>

<h2>Installing Python 3.14</h2>

<p>Don&rsquo;t have Python 3.14 installed yet?</p>

<p>If you have <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/">uv</a> installed, you can run this command to launch Python 3.14:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>uv run --python 3.14 python
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>That will automatically install 3.14 (if you don&rsquo;t have it yet) and run it.</p>

<h2>Setting a theme</h2>

<p>I have my terminal colors set to the Solarized Light color palette and I have Vim use a Solarized Light color scheme as well.</p>

<p>The REPL doesn&rsquo;t <em>quite</em> match my text editor by default:</p>

<p><img src="https://treyhunner.com/images/python3.14-repl-default-color-scheme.png" title="Python 3.14 REPL with default syntax highlighting" ></p>

<p>The numbers, comments, strings, and keywords are all different colors than my text editor.</p>

<p>This code makes the Python REPL use <em>nearly</em> the same syntax highlighting as my text editor:</p>

<h2>Using a <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> file</h2>

<p>You can use a <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> file to run code every time a new Python process starts.</p>

<p>If Python sees a <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> environment variable when it starts up, it will open that file and evaluate the code within it.</p>

<p>I have this in my <code>~/.zshrc</code> file to set the <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> environment variable to <code>~/.startup.py</code>:</p>

<p>Note that:</p>

<ol>
<li>I put all relevant code within a <code>_main</code> function so that the variables I set don&rsquo;t remain in the global scope of the Python REPL (they will by default)</li>
<li>I call the <code>_main</code> function and then delete the function afterward, again so the <code>_main</code> variable doesn&rsquo;t stay floating around in my REPL</li>
<li>I use <code>try</code>-<code>except</code>-<code>else</code> to ensure errors don&rsquo;t occur on Python 3.13 and below</li>
</ol>


<p>Also note that the syntax highlighting in the new REPL is <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/134953">not as fine-grained</a> as many other syntax highlighting tools.
I suspect that it may become a bit more granular over time, <strong>which may break the above code</strong>.</p>

<p>The <code>_colorize</code> module is currently an internal implementation detail and is deliberately undocumented.
Its API may change at any time, so <strong>the above code may break in Python 3.15</strong>.
If that happens, I&rsquo;ll just update my <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> file at that point.</p>

<h2>Packaging themes</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve stuck all of the above code in a <code>~/.startup.py</code> file and I set the <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> environment variable on my system to point to this file.</p>

<p>Instead of manually updating a startup file, is there any way to make these themes <em>installable</em>?</p>

<p>Well, if a <code>.pth</code> file is included in Python&rsquo;s <code>site-packages</code> directory, that file (which must be a single line) will be run whenever Python starts up.
In theory, a package could use such a file to import a module and then call a function that would set the color scheme for the REPL.
My <a href="https://github.com/treyhunner/dramatic">dramatic</a> package uses (<em>cough</em> abuses <em>cough</em>) <code>.pth</code> files in this way.</p>

<p>This sounds like a somewhat bad idea, but maybe not a <em>horrible</em> idea.</p>

<p>If you do this, let me know.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s your theme?</h2>

<p>Have you played with setting a theme in your own Python REPL?</p>

<p>What theme are you using?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m pretty much fully back to normal life after PyCon US 2025.</p>

<p>I started writing this post shortly after PyCon, got side-tracked, and now I&rsquo;m finally publishing it.</p>

<p><strong>My very quick recap</strong>: I spent a ton of time at PyCon chatting with folks and I <em>really</em> enjoyed it.
As Ned wrote, <a href="https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/202505/pycon_summer_camp.html">it&rsquo;s like summer camp</a>.</p>

<h2>My pre-conference (Monday and Tuesday)</h2>

<p>I flew in a couple days early (Monday May 12) because Breeze airlines had a non-stop flight from San Diego to Pittsburgh that only ran on Monday or Friday.
I listened to <a href="http://robertdputnam.com/the-upswing/">The Upswing</a> as I flew in and wondered <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/114496799621377766">how we can make our community less individualistic</a>.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, I went on <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/114495825740774796">a walking tour</a> of downtown Pittsburgh.
Then I ate Indian food for lunch at Sree&rsquo;s, which I chose because I saw they had great vegan lunch options and weren&rsquo;t open for dinner.
I was eating vegan during PyCon US (as I <em>mostly</em> do at home) and I remembered to do <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/114506541091205849">some research on vegan dinner restaurants in the area</a> this year.</p>

<p>On Tuesday night, as CPython core devs started showing up in the Westin lobby, I went on a walk with Anthony Shaw.
Anthony asked whether I was up for &ldquo;an adventure&rdquo; and I said yes without asking questions.
We walked across the river to Randyland (a.k.a. &ldquo;the mattress factory&rdquo;).
It was fun, interesting, and quite odd.
We were the only ones there and had plenty of time to look around at all the interesting items and art pieces that Randy had collected.</p>

<p>Anthony and I did dinner at Condado&rsquo;s and ran into more conference friends at the bar (Kattni, Rose, and Kojo).</p>

<h2>My tutorial on decorators (Wednesday)</h2>

<p>Wednesday was my tutorial day.</p>

<p>Attendees used sticky notes during the exercise sections to note when they needed help.
I wrote about this system in my <a href="https://treyhunner.com/2025/05/how-to-give-a-great-pycon-tutorial/">blog post of tips for giving a good PyCon tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>The tutorial went well and the attendees seemed to enjoy it.</p>

<h2>The newcomer&rsquo;s orientation &amp; education summit (Thursday)</h2>

<p>Just before the opening reception on Thursday evening, Kojo, Sumana, and I ran the <a href="https://mastodon.social/@pycon@fosstodon.org/114512798321665686">newcomer&rsquo;s orientation</a>.
Figuring out what exactly we want to say to help orient folks to PyCon is always a bit challenging.
A first-time PyCon attendee gave me some ideas for how we could do it even better next year.
I&rsquo;ve taken notes and will revisit them later.</p>

<p>I also attended a few talks during education summit earlier in the day.
Reuven Lerner gave a talk on how he recommends his students use LLMs and I was pleased to hear many suggestions that are closely aligned with what I recommend as well as a few insights I hadn&rsquo;t heard before.</p>

<h2>My lightning talk (Friday)</h2>

<p>I gave a lightning talk on Friday evening (the first talk day).
I called it <a href="https://youtu.be/Uuhu-F05A7k?feature=shared&amp;t=3174">Systems, gates, and rage</a>.
It seemed to go over well.
Folks occasionally told me throughout the conference that they enjoyed it.
I won&rsquo;t spoil the topic of my lightning talk (you&rsquo;ll need to watch it) but it&rsquo;s a topic that I&rsquo;d been thinking about for a few months.</p>

<p>Rodrigo gave a <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/114519939925398070">meta lightning talk</a> as the first talk of the first day.
I gave a meta lightning talk last year in the same slot.
I hope this becomes a tradition, where the first lightning talk is a talk about someone explaining how to give a lightning talk.</p>

<h2>The keynotes</h2>

<p>I really enjoyed the keynotes this year.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/ydVmzg_SJLw?feature=shared">Cory Doctorow&rsquo;s opening keynote</a> was <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/114519939925398070"><em>really</em> thought-provoking</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/Bglsof9b23k?feature=shared">Lynn Root&rsquo;s keynote</a> was on the importance <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/114519939925398070">of &ldquo;play&rdquo;</a>, which is a topic I&rsquo;ve written about before to my <a href="https://pym.dev/newsletter">mailing list</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/qog-dGVhSBI?feature=shared">The Marshall project</a> keynote and <a href="https://youtu.be/3UOLpTA7pRI?feature=shared">The Carpentries</a> keynote were also great, though I missed portions of each (beginning of one and end of another) and ended up watching the full videos online after the conference.</p>

<h2>The hallway track</h2>

<p>The &ldquo;hallway track&rdquo; is the way many PyCon attendees describe <strong>the discussions that happen organically in the hallway</strong>.</p>

<p>These discussions can happen at any time, including breaks, breakfast, lunch, and even during talks. I missed at least 3 talks this year because I was having a great discussion in the hallway and time got away from me.</p>

<p>PyCon&rsquo;s venue in Pittsburgh included a great <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/114512971414412295">rooftop</a> so the <strong>rooftop track</strong> / <strong>garden track</strong> was a lovely spin in the hallway track this year.</p>

<h2>The open spaces</h2>

<p>The open spaces are a very important part of PyCon for me.</p>

<p>Like the hallway track, the open spaces are mostly (usually) about having a conversation.
Unlike the hallway track, the open spaces have a <strong>set topic</strong>.</p>

<p>I attended open spaces (and <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/114526876252905533">ran my own</a>):</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Education and Outreach Working Group Open Space</strong>: I&rsquo;m part of this newly revived work group and we held this to hear topics that community members are interested in seeing the PSF focus on more deliberately</li>
<li><strong>t-strings: Let&rsquo;s build powerful templating together</strong>: I am interested in the new t-string feature in Python 3.14 and wanted to listen to this conversation (I contributed <em>a little bit</em> too)</li>
<li><strong>Computer Assisted Reporting and Investigative journalism</strong>: I was curious to hear this conversation, which included journalists, government employees who respond to information requests, and many others</li>
<li><strong>Python Skill-Building</strong>: I ran this open space on the roof during lunch time to chat about different Python skill-building services, including my own (<a href="https://pym.dev">Python Morsels</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Ask a Friendly Meat-Loving Vegan</strong>: I also ran this open space, inspired by a conversation I had the night before in a hotel lobby about animal farming, veganism, nutrition, and other related topics I&rsquo;ve thought/read a lot about</li>
</ul>


<p>I enjoyed meeting folks with similar interests and having fun and productive conversations (or at least listening to interesting conversations) in those open spaces.</p>

<h2>Dinners, games, and hotel lobby conversations</h2>

<p>I ate at Bae Bae&rsquo;s, Rosewater Grill, and APTEKA during the conference.
I also ate at Condado&rsquo;s at least 3 nights.</p>

<p>APTEKA was a fun trek for <a href="https://mastodon.social/@pythonbynight@fosstodon.org/114525581821316666">vegan PierogiCon</a> with mostly non-vegan folks.
I&rsquo;m sure the pierogis weren&rsquo;t authentic, but we all loved the food.</p>

<p>After dinner every night I went to the Westin lobby and either played <a href="https://treyhunner.com/2015/06/cabo-card-game/">the Cabo card game</a> or chatted with folks (<a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/114509076754402356">1</a>, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/114514682814457694">2</a>, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/114525878624139679">3</a>).</p>

<h2>On missing talks</h2>

<p>The keynotes and lightning talks are usually my favorite parts of PyCon.
I tried to watch as many live keynotes and lightning talk sessions as I could this year.
The morning lightning talks were hard to make it to because I kept sleeping in late enough that I missed most of them.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I watched <em>very few</em> live talks.
I missed talks due to sleeping in, attending open spaces, visiting booths in the exhibit hall, getting lost in conversations in the hallway, and mid-day taking naps (in my hotel room, not during talks!).</p>

<p>Hynek has <a href="https://hynek.me/articles/hallway-track/">written about the downside of the hallway track and the importance of attending talks</a>.
I sympathize with Hynek&rsquo;s argument that the hallway track is a trade off and there are downsides to missing talks, for both attendees and speakers.
I am grateful that folks give talks and I want to support folks who do give talks, and yet, I often find myself attending few talks.</p>

<p>Ironically, the one talk I ended up taking a nap through (again, in my hotel room, not <em>in the talk</em>) was Hynek&rsquo;s.
My brain was fried by the time of his talk and I&rsquo;m glad I was able to watch it online the week after PyCon.
He apparently had a completely packed room as it was!</p>

<p>I did make sure to show up to a talk by a conference friend who I wanted to support (Michael Dahlberg&rsquo;s <a href="https://youtu.be/LseCKvrp6og?feature=shared">talk on honeybee swarms</a>).
I have also binge-watched a dozen or so talks online that I had planned to attend but missed during PyCon.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PyConUS/videos">watch all talks online now</a> (at least I <em>think</em> they&rsquo;re all up now?).</p>

<h2>Attend a Python event</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to PyCon coming to Long Beach next year.
I&rsquo;m in San Diego and it will be nice to <em>not fly</em> to a PyCon for once!</p>

<p>I highly recommend attending local Python meetups, attending regional Python conferences, and/or attending PyCon US.
Most in-person Python community events are <em>pretty lovely</em>.
The Python community generally goes out of its way to be more welcoming than most tech events.</p>

<p>See you in Long Beach!</p>

    <updated>2025-04-18T11:45:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>https://treyhunner.com/2025/04/which-social-network-are-we-using-for-pycon</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last year I updated my <a href="https://treyhunner.com/2018/04/how-to-make-the-most-of-your-first-pycon/">having a great first PyCon</a> post to note that Mastodon would likely be more popular than Twitter at PyCon.</p>

<p>My guess was correct.
During PyCon US 2024, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/112453920848761679">Mastodon overtook Twitter</a> for the most posts on the <code>#PyConUS</code> hashtag.</p>

<p>In the fall of 2024, Bluesky really took off.
It currently seems like Bluesky is now a bit more popular than Mastodon for Python posts in general&hellip; but that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean it will be the most popular social media network during the conference.</p>

<p>This year I&rsquo;m guessing that Mastodon will still be the most popular network for <code>#PyConUS</code> posts, though I wouldn&rsquo;t be very surprised if Bluesky took the lead instead.</p>

<h2>What do the social networks think?</h2>

<p>I decided to pose this question to the various social networks via a poll. I made sure to share these polls using both the <code>#Python</code> and <code>#PyConUS</code> hashtags for visibility&rsquo;s sake.</p>

<p>The results?</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/treyhunner_pyconus-python-activity-7313960284581216256-DdzA/">LinkedIn poll</a>: LinkedIn isn&rsquo;t sure whether Twitter is the new Twitter</li>
<li><a href="https://x.com/treyhunner/status/1908187705965703323">Twitter poll</a> Twitter (mostly) knows that Bluesky is the new Twitter</li>
<li><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/trey.io/post/3llyswsgkut2h">Bluesky poll</a> Bluesky knows the really nerdy tech folks hang out on Mastodon</li>
<li><a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/114280595068705311">Mastodon poll</a> Mastodon loves itself above all else</li>
</ul>


<p>In other words, LinkedIn leans more toward Bluesky being the leader than Mastodon, Twitter leans toward Bluesky, but Bluesky and Mastodon both lean toward Mastodon being the leader during PyCon.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t mention Threads or other platforms because they didn&rsquo;t seem like real contenders given where the most active PyCon-attending Python-posting folks seem to hang out in 2025.</p>

<h2>The actual results</h2>

<p>Here are the actual results of the polls.</p>

<h3>LinkedIn</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/treyhunner_pyconus-python-activity-7313960284581216256-DdzA/"><img src="https://treyhunner.com/images/pycon-poll-linkedin-2025.png" title="LinkedIn poll results" ></a></p>

<h3>Twitter</h3>

<p><a href="https://x.com/treyhunner/status/1908187705965703323"><img src="https://treyhunner.com/images/pycon-poll-twitter-2025.png" title="Twitter poll results" ></a></p>

<h3>Bluesky</h3>

<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/trey.io/post/3llyswsgkut2h"><img src="https://treyhunner.com/images/pycon-poll-bluesky-2025.png" title="Bluesky poll results" ></a></p>

<h3>Mastodon</h3>

<p><a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/114280595068705311"><img src="https://treyhunner.com/images/pycon-poll-mastodon-2025.png" title="Mastodon poll results" ></a></p>

<h2>We&rsquo;re still fragmented</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, regardless of which network is the leader this year during PyCon US, we&rsquo;re still going to be much more fragmented than we used to be. Twitter <em>was</em> the clear leader years ago and it very clearly isn&rsquo;t anymore&hellip; at least not for PyCon US conference chatter.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be checking Mastodon and Bluesky and will post on <em>at least</em> Mastodon and possibly also Bluesky. I hope that other folks will also use one of these 2 social networks to organize dinners and gatherings! 🤞</p>

<p>Feel free to follow me <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner">on Mastodon</a> and <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner">Bluesky</a> during the conference.</p>

<p>Also let me know if you&rsquo;d like to join my <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/trey.io/post/3ln45jpzmik2c">PyCon US starter pack</a> on Bluesky.
Lists on Mastodon require following and I prefer not to follow everyone I meet at PyCon so, unfortunately, I probably won&rsquo;t have a Mastodon equivalent of this. 😢</p>

<p>I recommend checking the <code>#PyConUS</code> hashtag on both networks as well.
Note that you can <em>subscribe</em> to hashtags on Mastodon which is pretty neat!</p>

<h2>See you at PyCon!</h2>

<p>If this will be your first PyCon US, I recommend signing up for both Mastodon and Bluesky and checking the <code>#PyConUS</code> hashtag during the conference.</p>

<p>Also, be sure to see my <a href="https://treyhunner.com/2018/04/how-to-make-the-most-of-your-first-pycon/">post on having a great first PyCon</a> and <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/112448459788776426">see this additional tips</a>.</p>

    <link href="https://treyhunner.com/2024/12/lazy-self-installing-python-scripts-with-uv/"/>
    <updated>2024-12-09T11:15:10-08:00</updated>
    <id>https://treyhunner.com/2024/12/lazy-self-installing-python-scripts-with-uv</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I frequently find myself writing my own short command-line scripts in Python that help me with day-to-day tasks.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s <em>so</em> easy to throw together a single-file Python command-line script and throw it in my <code>~/bin</code> directory!</p>

<p>Well&hellip; it&rsquo;s easy, <em>unless</em> the script requires anything outside of the Python standard library.</p>

<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve started using uv and my <em>primary</em> for use for it has been fixing Python&rsquo;s &ldquo;just manage the dependencies automatically&rdquo; problem.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll share how I&rsquo;ve been using uv&hellip; first first let&rsquo;s look at the problem.</p>

<h2>A script without dependencies</h2>

<p>If I have a Python script that I want to be easily usable from anywhere on my system, I typically follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Add an appropriate shebang line above the first line in the file (e.g. <code>#!/usr/bin/env python3</code>)</li>
<li>Set an executable bit on the file (<code>chmod a+x my_script.py</code>)</li>
<li>Place the script in a directory that&rsquo;s in my shell&rsquo;s <code>PATH</code> variable (e.g. <code>cp my_script.py ~/bin/my_script</code>)</li>
</ol>


<p>For example, here&rsquo;s a script I use to print out 80 zeroes (or a specific number of zeroes) to check whether my terminal&rsquo;s font size is large enough when I&rsquo;m teaching:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="c">#!/usr/bin/env python3</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">sys</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">numbers</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">argv</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">:]</span> <span class="ow">or</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">80</span><span class="p">]</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">numbers</span><span class="p">:</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;0&quot;</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="nb">int</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">))</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This file lives at <code>/home/trey/bin/0</code> so I can run the command <code>0</code> from my system prompt to see 80 <code>0</code> characters printed in my terminal.</p>

<p>This works great!
But this script doesn&rsquo;t have any dependencies.</p>

<h2>The problem: a script with dependencies</h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a Python script that normalizes the audio of a given video file and writes a new audio-normalized version of the video to a new file:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>This script depends on the <a href="https://github.com/slhck/ffmpeg-normalize">ffmpeg-normalize</a> Python package and the <a href="https://ffmpeg.org">ffmpeg</a> utility.
I already have <code>ffmpeg</code> installed, but I prefer <em>not</em> to globally install Python packages.
I install all Python packages within virtual environments and I install global Python scripts using <a href="https://pipx.pypa.io">pipx</a>.</p>

<p>At this point I <em>could</em> choose to either:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a virtual environment, install <code>ffmpeg-normalize</code> in it, and put a shebang line referencing that virtual environment&rsquo;s Python binary at the top of my script file</li>
<li>Turn my script into a <code>pip</code>-installable Python package with a <code>pyproject.toml</code> that lists <code>ffmpeg-normalize</code> as a dependency and use <code>pipx</code> to install it</li>
</ol>


<p>That first solution requires me to keep track of virtual environments that exist for specific scripts to work.
That sounds painful.</p>

<p>The second solution involves making a Python package and then upgrading that Python package whenever I need to make a change to this script.
That&rsquo;s definitely going to be painful.</p>

<h2>The solution: let uv handle it</h2>

<p>A few months ago, my friend <a href="https://micro.webology.dev">Jeff Triplett</a> showed me that <code>uv</code> can work within a shebang line and can read a special comment at the top of a Python file that tells uv which Python version to run a script with and which dependencies it needs.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a shebang line that would work for the above script:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="c">#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># /// script</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># requires-python = &quot;&gt;=3.12&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># dependencies = [</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c">#     &quot;ffmpeg-normalize&quot;,</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># ]</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># ///</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>That tells uv that this script should be run on Python 3.12 and that it depends on the <code>ffmpeg-normalize</code> package.</p>

<p>Neat&hellip; but what does that do?</p>

<p>Well, the first time this script is run, uv will create a virtual environment for it, install <code>ffmpeg-normalize</code> into that venv, and then run the script:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>normalize
</span><span class='line'>Reading inline script metadata from <span class="sb">`</span>/home/trey/bin/normalize<span class="sb">`</span>
</span><span class='line'>Installed <span class="m">4</span> packages in 5ms
</span><span class='line'>usage: normalize <span class="o">[</span>-h<span class="o">]</span> video_file output_file
</span><span class='line'>normalize: error: the following arguments are required: video_file, output_file
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Every time the script is run after that, uv finds and reuses the same virtual environment:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>normalize
</span><span class='line'>Reading inline script metadata from <span class="sb">`</span>/home/trey/bin/normalize<span class="sb">`</span>
</span><span class='line'>usage: normalize <span class="o">[</span>-h<span class="o">]</span> video_file output_file
</span><span class='line'>normalize: error: the following arguments are required: video_file, output_file
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Each time uv runs the script, it quickly checks that all listed dependencies are properly installed with their correct versions.</p>

<p>Another script I use this for is <a href="https://github.com/treyhunner/dotfiles/blob/main/bin/caption">caption</a>, which uses whisper (via the Open AI API) to quickly caption my screencasts just after I record and edit them.
The caption quality very rarely need more than a very minor edit or two (for my personal accent of English at least) even for technical like &ldquo;dunder method&rdquo; and via the API the captions generate very quickly.</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/inline-script-metadata/">inline script metadata</a> page of the Python packaging users guide for more details on that format that uv is using (honestly I always just copy-paste an example myself).</p>

<h2>uv everywhere?</h2>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t yet fully embraced uv everywhere.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t manage my Python projects with uv, though I do use it to create new virtual environments (with <code>--seed</code> to ensure the <code>pip</code> command is available) as a <a href="https://treyhunner.com/2024/10/switching-from-virtualenvwrapper-to-direnv-starship-and-uv/">virtualenvwrapper replacement, along with direnv</a>.</p>

<p>I have also started using <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/tools/">uv tool</a> as a <a href="https://pipx.pypa.io">pipx</a> replacement and I&rsquo;ve considered replacing <a href="https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/">pyenv</a> with uv.</p>

<h2>uv instead of pipx</h2>

<p>When I want to install a command-line tool that happens to be Python powered, I used to do this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>pipx countdown-cli
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now I do this instead:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>uv tool install countdown-cli
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Either way, I end up with a <code>countdown</code> script in my <code>PATH</code> that automatically uses its own separate virtual environment for its dependencies:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
<span class='line-number'>16</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>countdown --help
</span><span class='line'>Usage: countdown <span class="o">[</span>OPTIONS<span class="o">]</span> DURATION

</span><span class='line'>  - 2m30s <span class="o">(</span><span class="m">2</span> minutes and <span class="m">30</span> seconds<span class="o">)</span>

</span><span class='line'>  --version  Show the version and exit.
</span><span class='line'>  --help     Show this message and exit.
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>uv instead of pyenv</h2>

<p>For years, I&rsquo;ve used pyenv to manage multiple versions of Python on my machine.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>pyenv install 3.13.0
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now I could do this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>uv python install --preview 3.13.0
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Or I could make a <code>~/.config/uv/uv.toml</code> file containing this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">preview</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">true</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And then run the same thing without the <code>--preview</code> flag:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>uv python install 3.13.0
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This puts a <code>python3.13</code> binary in my <code>~/.local/bin directory</code>, which is on my <code>PATH</code>.</p>

<p>Why &ldquo;preview&rdquo;?
Well, without it uv doesn&rsquo;t (<a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/6265#issuecomment-2461107903">yet</a>) place <code>python3.13</code> in my <code>PATH</code> by default, as this feature is currently in testing/development.</p>

<h2>Self-installing Python scripts are the big win</h2>

<p>I still prefer pyenv for its ability to <a href="https://treyhunner.com/2024/05/installing-a-custom-python-build-with-pyenv/">install custom Python builds</a> and I don&rsquo;t have a preference between <code>uv tool</code> and <code>pipx</code>.</p>

<p>The biggest win that I&rsquo;ve experienced from uv so far is the ability to run an executable script and have any necessary dependencies install automagically.</p>

<p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean that I <em>never</em> make Python package out of my Python scripts anymore&hellip; but I do so much more rarely.
I used to create a Python package out of a script as soon as it required third-party dependencies.
Now my &ldquo;do I <em>really</em> need to turn this into a proper package&rdquo; bar is set much higher.</p>

    <link href="https://treyhunner.com/2024/11/new-python-jumpstart-course/"/>
    <updated>2024-11-25T08:08:08-08:00</updated>
    <id>https://treyhunner.com/2024/11/new-python-jumpstart-course</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve just recently launched a self-paced introduction to Python that is <strong>extremely hands-on</strong>.
It&rsquo;s called <strong><a href="https://pym.dev/courses/jumpstart/overview">Python Jumpstart</a></strong> and it&rsquo;s based on introductory Python curriculum that I have been iterating on for years.</p>

<h2>Learn Python by writing Python code ✍</h2>

<p>We <em>do not</em> learn by putting information into the brain.
Our brains simply don&rsquo;t retain knowledge that way.</p>

<p>Learning happens from repeatedly attempting to retrieve information <em>from</em> the brain.
When it comes to Python, that means <strong>writing Python code</strong>.</p>

<p>So unlike most Python courses, Python Jumpstart is <em>not</em> focused on watching videos and rewriting code seen within videos.
Instead, this new Python course is based around <strong>learning Python by writing Python code</strong>.</p>

<h2>How Python Jumpstart is structured 🔬</h2>

<p>Python Jumpstart includes learning Python by solving <strong>46 short Python exercises</strong>.</p>

<p>Before each exercise, you&rsquo;ll watch a 5 minute video explaining a new Python topic.
You&rsquo;ll then attempt the exercise to put one or more Python topics into practice.</p>

<p>You won&rsquo;t solve many of the exercises on your first try and <em>that&rsquo;s okay</em>.
These exercises are designed to be revisited a few times over the course of weeks, until you&rsquo;re satisfied with your solution.</p>

<h2>This is not a sprint 📆</h2>

<p>This structured path to Python proficiency, includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Carefully crafted exercises that build real understanding</li>
<li>Short, detailed explanations that <em>won&rsquo;t</em> waste your time</li>
<li>A proven teaching approach that focuses on active learning</li>
<li>Spaced repetition to help concepts stick</li>
</ul>


<p>This is not a course for impatient or passive learners.
Learning takes <strong>repetitive effort</strong> spaced over many days and this course is structured to embrace that fact.</p>

<p>If you spend <strong>30 minutes</strong> on Python Jumpstart each day, I estimate that you&rsquo;ll complete this course in <strong>about 7 weeks</strong>.
You&rsquo;ll spend the large majority of that time writing Python code.</p>

<p>This course <em>will</em> take time, but it will be time well-spent.</p>

<h2>Launch week special: 50% off until December 2 ⏰</h2>

<p>Through Monday December 2, 2024, you can get lifetime access to <a href="https://pym.dev/courses/jumpstart/overview">Python Jumpstart</a> for <strong>$99</strong>.
After this launch week, Python Jumpstart will be <strong>$199</strong>.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Adding keyboard shortcuts to the Python REPL]]></title>
    <link href="https://treyhunner.com/2024/10/adding-keyboard-shortcuts-to-the-python-repl/"/>
    <updated>2024-10-28T07:15:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>https://treyhunner.com/2024/10/adding-keyboard-shortcuts-to-the-python-repl</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I talked about the new Python 3.13 REPL <a href="https://treyhunner.com/2024/05/my-favorite-python-3-dot-13-feature/">a few months ago</a> and <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/python-313-whats-new/">after 3.13 was released</a>.
I think it&rsquo;s <strong>awesome</strong>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to share a secret feature within the Python 3.13 REPL which I&rsquo;ve been finding useful recently: <strong>adding custom keyboard shortcuts</strong>.</p>

<p>This feature involves a <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> file, use of an unsupported Python module, and dynamically evaluating code.</p>

<p>In short, we may be getting ourselves into trouble.
But the result is <em>very</em> neat!</p>

<p>Thanks to Łukasz Llanga for inspiring this post via his excellent <a href="https://youtu.be/dK6HGcSb60Y?si=jWPEa8BcdYGnW9l6">EuroPython keynote talk</a>.</p>

<h2>The goal: keyboard shortcuts in the REPL</h2>

<p>First, I&rsquo;d like to explain the end result.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say I&rsquo;m in the Python REPL on my machine and I&rsquo;ve typed <code>numbers =</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='pycon'><span class='line'><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">numbers</span> <span class="o">=</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I can now hit <code>Ctrl-N</code> to enter a list of numbers I often use while teaching (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_number">Lucas numbers</a>):</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='pycon'><span class='line'><span class="go">numbers = [2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29]</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>That saved me some typing!</p>

<h2>Getting a prototype working</h2>

<p>First, let&rsquo;s try out an example command.</p>

<p>Copy-paste this into your Python 3.13 REPL:</p>

<p>Now hit <code>Ctrl-N</code>.</p>

<p>If all worked as planned, you should see that list of numbers entered into the REPL.</p>

<p>Cool!
Now let&rsquo;s generalize this trick and make Python run our code whenever it starts.</p>

<p>But first&hellip; a disclaimer.</p>

<h2>Here be dragons 🐉</h2>

<p>Notice that <code>_</code> prefix in the <code>_pyrepl</code> module that we&rsquo;re importing from?
That means this module is officially unsupported.</p>

<p>The <code>_pyrepl</code> module is an implementation detail and its implementation may change at any time in future Python versions.</p>

<p>In other words: <code>_pyrepl</code> is designed to be used by <em>Python&rsquo;s standard library modules</em> and not anyone else.
That means that we should assume this code will break in a future Python version.</p>

<p>Will that stop us from playing with this module for the fun of it?</p>

<p>It won&rsquo;t.</p>

<h2>Creating a <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> file</h2>

<p>So we&rsquo;ve made <em>one</em> custom key combination for ourselves.
How can we setup this command automatically whenever the Python REPL starts?</p>

<p>We need a <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> file.</p>

<p>When Python launches, if it sees a <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> environment variable it will treat that environment variable as a Python file to run on startup.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve made a <code>/home/trey/.python_startup.py</code> file and I&rsquo;ve set this environment variable in my shell&rsquo;s configuration file (<code>~/.zshrc</code>):</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">PYTHONSTARTUP</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$HOME</span>/.python_startup.py
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>To start, we could put our single custom command in this file:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Note that I&rsquo;ve stuck our code in a <code>try</code>-<code>except</code> block.
Our code <em>only</em> runs if those <code>_pyrepl</code> imports succeed.</p>

<p>Note that this <em>might</em> still raise an exception when Python starts <em>if</em> the reader object&rsquo;s <code>command</code> attribute or <code>bind</code> method change in a way that breaks our code.</p>

<p>Personally, I&rsquo;d like to see those breaking changes occur print out a traceback the next time I upgrade Python.
So I&rsquo;m going to leave those last few lines <em>without</em> their own catch-all exception handler.</p>

<p>This version uses a dictionary to map keyboard shortcuts to the text they should insert.</p>

<p>Note that we&rsquo;re repeatedly building up a string of <code>Command</code> subclasses for each shortcut, using <code>exec</code> to execute the code for that custom <code>Command</code> subclass, and then binding the keyboard shortcut to that new command class.</p>

<p>At the end we then delete all the variables we&rsquo;ve made so our REPL will start the clean global environment we normally expect it to have:</p>

<p>Is this messy?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Is that a needless use of a dictionary that could have been a list of 2-item tuples instead?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Does this work?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<h2>Doing more interesting and risky stuff</h2>

<p>Note that there are many keyboard shortcuts that may cause weird behaviors if you bind them.</p>

<p>For example, if you bind <code>Ctrl-i</code>, your binding may trigger every time you try to indent.
And if you try to bind <code>Ctrl-m</code>, your binding may be ignored because this is equivalent to hitting the <code>Enter</code> key.</p>

<p>So be sure to test your REPL carefully after each new binding you try to invent.</p>

<p>If you want to do something more interesting, you could poke around in the <code>_pyrepl</code> package to see what existing code you can use/abuse.</p>

<p>For example, here&rsquo;s a very hacky way of making a binding to <code>Ctrl-x</code> followed by <code>Ctrl-r</code> to make this import <code>subprocess</code>, type in a <code>subprocess.run</code> line, and move your cursor between the empty string within the <code>run</code> call:</p>

<h2>What keyboard shortcuts are available?</h2>

<p>As you play with customizing keyboard shortcuts, you&rsquo;ll likely notice that many key combinations result in strange and undesirable behavior when overridden.</p>

<p>For example, overriding <code>Ctrl-J</code> will also override the <code>Enter</code> key&hellip; at least it does in my terminal.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll list the key combinations that seem unproblematic on my setup with Gnome Terminal in Ubuntu Linux.</p>

<p>Here are <code>Control</code> key shortcuts that seem to be complete unused in the Python REPL:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Ctrl-N</code></li>
<li><code>Ctrl-O</code></li>
<li><code>Ctrl-P</code></li>
<li><code>Ctrl-Q</code></li>
<li><code>Ctrl-S</code></li>
<li><code>Ctrl-V</code></li>
</ul>


<p>Note that overriding <code>Ctrl-H</code> is often an alternative to the backspace key</p>

<p>Here are <code>Alt</code>/<code>Meta</code> key shortcuts that appear unused on my machine:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Alt-A</code></li>
<li><code>Alt-E</code></li>
<li><code>Alt-G</code></li>
<li><code>Alt-H</code></li>
<li><code>Alt-I</code></li>
<li><code>Alt-J</code></li>
<li><code>Alt-K</code></li>
<li><code>Alt-M</code></li>
<li><code>Alt-N</code></li>
<li><code>Alt-O</code></li>
<li><code>Alt-P</code></li>
<li><code>Alt-Q</code></li>
<li><code>Alt-S</code></li>
<li><code>Alt-V</code></li>
<li><code>Alt-W</code></li>
<li><code>Alt-X</code></li>
<li><code>Alt-Z</code></li>
</ul>


<p>You can add an <code>Alt</code> shortcut by using <code>\M</code> (for &ldquo;meta&rdquo;).
So <code>r"\M-a"</code> would capture <code>Alt-A</code> just as <code>r"\C-a"</code> would capture <code>Ctrl-A</code>.</p>

<p>Here are keyboard shortcuts that <em>can</em> be customized but you might want to consider whether the current default behavior is worth losing:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Alt-B</code>: backward word (same as <code>Ctrl-Left</code>)</li>
<li><code>Alt-C</code>: capitalize word (does nothing on my machine&hellip;)</li>
<li><code>Alt-D</code>: kill word (delete to end of word)</li>
<li><code>Alt-F</code>: forward word (same as <code>Ctrl-Right</code>)</li>
<li><code>Alt-L</code>: downcase word (does nothing on my machine&hellip;)</li>
<li><code>Alt-U</code>: upcase word (does nothing on my machine&hellip;)</li>
<li><code>Alt-Y</code>: yank pop</li>
<li><code>Ctrl-A</code>: beginning of line (like the <code>Home</code> key)</li>
<li><code>Ctrl-B</code>: left (like the <code>Left</code> key)</li>
<li><code>Ctrl-E</code>: end of line (like the <code>End</code> key)</li>
<li><code>Ctrl-F</code>: right (like the <code>Right</code> key)</li>
<li><code>Ctrl-G</code>: cancel</li>
<li><code>Ctrl-H</code>: backspace (same as the <code>Backspace</code> key)</li>
<li><code>Ctrl-K</code>: kill line (delete to end of line)</li>
<li><code>Ctrl-T</code>: transpose characters</li>
<li><code>Ctrl-U</code>: line discard (delete to beginning of line)</li>
<li><code>Ctrl-W</code>: word discard (delete to beginning of word)</li>
<li><code>Ctrl-Y</code>: yank</li>
<li><code>Alt-R</code>: restore history (within history mode)</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Your new Django project uses Python 3.13.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re really looking forward to using the new REPL&hellip; but <code>python manage.py shell</code> just shows the same old Python REPL.
What gives?</p>

<p>Well, Django&rsquo;s management shell uses Python&rsquo;s <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/code.html">code</a> module to launch a custom REPL, but the <code>code</code> module doesn&rsquo;t (<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/119512">yet</a>) use the new Python REPL.</p>

<p>So you&rsquo;re out of luck&hellip; or are you?</p>

<h2>How stable do you need your <code>shell</code> command to be?</h2>

<p>The new Python REPL&rsquo;s code lives in a <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/v3.13.0/Lib/_pyrepl">_pyrepl</a> package.
Surely there must be some way to launch the new REPL using that <code>_pyrepl</code> package!</p>

<p>First, note the <code>_</code> before that package name.
It&rsquo;s <code>_pyrepl</code>, not <code>pyrepl</code>.</p>

<p>Any solution that relies on this module may break in future Python releases.</p>

<p>So&hellip; should we give up on looking for a solution, if we can&rsquo;t get a &ldquo;stable&rdquo; one?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>

<p>My <code>shell</code> command doesn&rsquo;t usually <em>need</em> to be stable in more than one version of Python at a time.
So I&rsquo;m fine with a solution that <em>attempts</em> to use the new REPL and then falls back to the old REPL if it fails.</p>

<h2>A working solution</h2>

<p>So, let&rsquo;s look at a working solution.</p>

<p>Stick <a href="https://pym.dev/p/2zqeq/">this code</a> in a <code>management/commands/shell.py</code> file within one of your Django apps:</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>Django&rsquo;s <code>shell</code> command has made it very simple to add support for your favorite REPL of choice.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/5.1.2/django/core/management/commands/shell.py">The code for the <code>shell</code> command</a> loops through the <code>shells</code> list and attempts to run a method with that name on its own class.
If an <code>ImportError</code> is raised then it attempts the next command, stopping once no exception occurs.</p>

<p>Our new command will try to use IPython and bpython if they&rsquo;re installed and then it will try the new Python 3.13 REPL followed by the old Python REPL.</p>

<p>If Python 3.14 breaks our import by moving the <code>interactive_console</code> function, then an <code>ImportError</code> will be raised, causing us to fall back to the old REPL after we upgrade to Python 3.14 one day.
If instead, the <code>interactive_console</code> function&rsquo;s usage changes (maybe it will require arguments) then our <code>shell</code> command will completely break and we&rsquo;ll need to manually fix it when we upgrade to Python 3.14.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s so great about the new REPL?</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re already using IPython or BPython as your REPL and you&rsquo;re enjoying them, I would stick with them.</p>

<p>Third-party libraries move faster than Python itself and they&rsquo;re often more feature-rich.
IPython has about 20 years worth of feature development and it has features that the built-in Python REPL will likely never have.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re using the default Python REPL though, this new REPL is a <em>huge</em> upgrade.
I&rsquo;ve been using it as my default REPL since May and I <em>love</em> it.
See <a href="https://pym.dev/python-313-whats-new/">my screencast on Python 3.13</a> for my favorite features in the new REPL.</p>

    <id>https://treyhunner.com/2024/10/switching-from-virtualenvwrapper-to-direnv-starship-and-uv</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this week I considered whether I should finally switch away from <a href="https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io">virtualenvwrapper</a> to using local <code>.venv</code> managed by <a href="https://direnv.net">direnv</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never seriously used direnv, but I&rsquo;ve been hearing <a href="https://micro.webology.dev/2024/03/13/on-environment-variables.html">Jeff</a> and <a href="https://hynek.me/til/python-project-local-venvs/">Hynek</a> talk about their use of direnv for a while.</p>

<p>After a few days, I&rsquo;ve finally stumbled into a setup that works great for me.
I&rsquo;d like to note the basics of this setup as well as some fancy additions that are specific to my own use case.</p>

<h2>My old virtualenvwrapper workflow</h2>

<p>First, I&rsquo;d like to note my <em>old</em> workflow that I&rsquo;m trying to roughly recreate:</p>

<ol>
<li>I type <code>mkvenv3 &lt;project_name&gt;</code> to create a new virtual environment for the current project directory and activate it</li>
<li>I type <code>workon &lt;project_name&gt;</code> when I want to workon that project: this activates the correct virtual environment <em>and</em> changes to the project directory</li>
</ol>


<p>The initial setup I thought of allows me to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Run <code>echo layout python &gt; .envrc &amp;&amp; direnv allow</code> to create a virtual environment for the current project and activate it</li>
<li>Change directories into the project directory to automatically activate the virtual environment</li>
</ol>


<p>The more complex setup I eventually settled on allows me to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Run <code>venv &lt;project_name&gt;</code> to create a virtual environment for the current project and activate it</li>
<li>Run <code>workon &lt;project_name&gt;</code> to change directories into the project (which automatically activates the virtual environment)</li>
</ol>


<h2>The initial setup</h2>

<p>First, I <a href="https://direnv.net">installed direnv</a> and added this to my <code>~/.zshrc</code> file:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nb">eval</span> <span class="s2">&quot;$(direnv hook zsh)&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then whenever I wanted to create a virtual environment for a new project I created a <code>.envrc</code> file in that directory, which looked like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>layout python
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then I ran <code>direnv allow</code> to allow, as <code>direnv</code> instructed me to, to allow the new virtual environment to be automatically created and activated.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s pretty much it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I did not like this initial setup.</p>

<h2>No shell prompt?</h2>

<p>The first problem was that the virtual environment&rsquo;s prompt didn&rsquo;t show up in my shell prompt.
This is due to a <a href="https://github.com/direnv/direnv/issues/529">direnv not allowing modification of the <code>PS1</code> shell prompt</a>.
That means I&rsquo;d need to modify my shell configuration to show the correct virtual environment name myself.</p>

<p>So I added this to my <code>~/.zshrc</code> file to show the virtual environment name at the beginning of my prompt:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="c"># Add direnv-activated venv to prompt</span>
</span><span class='line'>show_virtual_env<span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>

</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;($(basename $VIRTUAL_ENV_PROMPT)) &quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">fi</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">PS1</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;$(show_virtual_env)&#39;</span><span class="nv">$PS1</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Wrong virtual environment directory</h2>

<p>The next problem was that the virtual environment was placed in <code>.direnv/python3.12</code>.
I wanted each virtual environment to be in a <code>.venv</code> directory instead.</p>

<p>To do that, I made a <code>.config/direnv/direnvrc</code> file that customized the python layout:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>14</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>layout_python<span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>

</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">[[</span> -z <span class="nv">$VIRTUAL_ENV</span> <span class="o">||</span> ! -d <span class="nv">$VIRTUAL_ENV</span> <span class="o">]]</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">then</span>
</span><span class='line'>        log_status <span class="s2">&quot;No virtual environment exists. Executing \`python -m venv .venv\`.&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>        python -m venv .venv
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="nv">VIRTUAL_ENV</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;$(pwd)/.venv&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">fi</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="c"># Activate the virtual environment</span>
</span><span class='line'>    . <span class="nv">$VIRTUAL_ENV</span>/bin/activate
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Loading, unloading, loading, unloading&hellip;</h2>

<p>I also didn&rsquo;t like the loading and unloading messages that showed up each time I changed directories.
I removed those by clearing the <code>DIRENV_LOG_FORMAT</code> variable in my <code>~/.zshrc</code> configuration:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">DIRENV_LOG_FORMAT</span><span class="o">=</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>The more advanced setup</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t like it when all my virtual environment prompts show up as <code>.venv</code>.
I want ever prompt to be the name of the actual project&hellip; which is usually the directory name.</p>

<p>I also <em>really</em> wanted to be able to type <code>venv</code> to create a new virtual environment, activate it, and create the <code>.envrc</code> file for my <em>automatically</em>.</p>

<p>Additionally, I thought it would be really handy if I could type <code>workon &lt;project_name&gt;</code> to change directories to a specific project.</p>

<p>I made two aliases in my <code>~/.zshrc</code> configuration for all of this:</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now I can type this to create a <code>.venv</code> virtual environment in my current directory, which has a prompt named after the current directory, activate it, and create a <code>.envrc</code> file which will automatically activate that virtual environment (thanks to that <code>~/.config/direnv/direnvrc</code> file) whenever I change into that directory:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>venv
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If I wanted to customized the prompt name for the virtual environment, I could do this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>venv my_project
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>When I wanted to start working on that project later, I can either change into that directory <em>or</em> if I&rsquo;m feeling lazy I can simply type:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>workon my_project
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>That reads from my <code>~/.projects</code> file to look up the project directory to switch to.</p>

<h2>Switching to uv</h2>

<p>I also decided to try using <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/">uv</a> for all of this, since it&rsquo;s faster at creating virtual environments.
One benefit of <code>uv</code> is that it tries to select the correct Python version for the project, if it sees a version noted in a <code>pyproject.toml</code> file.</p>

<p>Another benefit of using <code>uv</code>, is that I should also be able to update the <code>venv</code> to use a specific version of Python with something like <code>--python 3.12</code>.</p>

<p>Here are the updated shell aliases for the <code>~/.zshrc</code> for <code>uv</code>:</p>

<h2>Switching to starship</h2>

<p>I also decided to try out using <a href="https://starship.rs">Starship</a> to customize my shell this week.</p>

<p>I added this to my <code>~/.zshrc</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nb">eval</span> <span class="s2">&quot;$(starship init zsh)&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And removed this, which is no longer needed since Starship will be managing the shell for me:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;($(basename $VIRTUAL_ENV_PROMPT)) &quot;</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I also switched my <code>python</code> layout for direnv to just set the <code>$VIRTUAL_ENV</code> variable and add the <code>$VIRTUAL_ENV/bin</code> directory to my <code>PATH</code>, since the <code>$VIRTUAL_ENV_PROMPT</code> variable isn&rsquo;t needed for Starship to pick up the prompt:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>layout_python<span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>

</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nb">export </span>VIRTUAL_ENV
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I also made a <em>very</em> boring Starship configuration in <code>~/.config/starship.toml</code>:</p>

<p>I setup such a boring configuration because when I&rsquo;m teaching, I don&rsquo;t want my students to be confused or distracted by a prompt that has considerably more information in it than <em>their</em> default prompt may have.</p>

<p>The biggest downside of switching to Starship has been my own earworm-oriented brain.
As I update my Starship configuration files, I&rsquo;ve repeatedly heard David Bowie singing &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Starmaaan&rdquo;. 🎶</p>

<h2>Ground control to major TOML</h2>

<p>After all of that, I realized that I could additionally use different Starship configurations for different directories by putting a <code>STARSHIP_CONFIG</code> variable in specific layouts.
After that realization, I made my configuration even <em>more</em> vanilla and made some alternative configurations in my <code>~/.config/direnv/direnvrc</code> file:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>layout_python<span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nv">VIRTUAL_ENV</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;$(pwd)/.venv&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    PATH_add <span class="s2">&quot;$VIRTUAL_ENV/bin&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nb">export </span>VIRTUAL_ENV
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">STARSHIP_CONFIG</span><span class="o">=</span>/home/trey/.config/starship/python.toml
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>layout_git<span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">STARSHIP_CONFIG</span><span class="o">=</span>/home/trey/.config/starship/git.toml
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Those other two configuration files are fancier, as I have no concern about them distracting my students since I&rsquo;ll never be within those directories while teaching.</p>

<p>You can find those files in <a href="https://github.com/treyhunner/dotfiles">my dotfiles repository</a>.</p>

<h2>The necessary tools</h2>

<p>So I replaced virtualenvwrapper with direnv, uv, and Starship.
Though direnv is doing most of the important work here.
The use of uv and Starship were just bonuses.</p>

<p>I <em>am</em> also hoping to eventually replace my pipx use with uv and once uv supports <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/6265">adding python3.x commands</a> to my <code>PATH</code>, I may replace my use of pyenv with uv as well.</p>

<p>Thanks to all who <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/113232640710715449">participated in my Mastodon thread</a> as I fumbled through discovering this setup.</p>

    <link href="https://treyhunner.com/2024/08/python-high-five/"/>
    <updated>2024-08-20T14:20:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>https://treyhunner.com/2024/08/python-high-five</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ever wished you could take an <strong>Intro to Python training</strong> with me, but you don&rsquo;t work for a company with a generous training budget?
I&rsquo;m running a Python-learning program just for this situation.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/high-five/">Python High Five</a> is a 10-week Python jumpstart program that starts <strong>this September</strong>.</p>

<h2>Set aside the time to learn ⌚</h2>

<p>One of the biggest problems for folks starting to learn Python is <strong>setting aside the time</strong>.
And even if you <em>do</em> manage to set aside the time, you&rsquo;ll often hit a roadblock where you feel <strong>confused</strong>.</p>

<p>Python High Five is a way to keep a <strong>daily learning habit</strong> <em>and</em> to <strong>get help</strong> when find yourself stuck.</p>

<p>This program is based around <strong>daily practice</strong>.
Monday through Friday you&rsquo;ll pick <strong>30 minutes</strong> from your schedule, at any time that works you.
During those 30 minutes, you&rsquo;ll watch a 5 minute video, work on the day&rsquo;s exercise, and reflect on your progress.</p>

<h2>The most effective learning is hands-on 🖐️</h2>

<p>Python High Five is all about learning through <strong>writing Python code</strong>.
Each week we&rsquo;ll dive deeper into Python, building upon what we&rsquo;ve learned so far.</p>

<p>When you find yourself stuck you can get help through an asynchronous <strong>group chat</strong> and weekly <strong>office hour</strong> sessions.
In addition to our weekly office hours together, I&rsquo;ll check the chat each day, respond to questions, and provide guidance.</p>

<h2>Proven learning techniques behind the scenes 📝</h2>

<p>The daily check-ins allow for daily <strong>accountability</strong>.
The group chat also provides both a community of peers to rely on, and <strong>guidance from an experienced Python trainer</strong> (me).</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll also be using proven learning techniques behind the scenes:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Retrieval practice</strong>: you don&rsquo;t learn by putting information into your head, but by trying to take it out; for Python learning, that means writing code.</li>
<li><strong>Spaced repetition</strong>: cramming is less effective than learning spaced out over time, which is why we&rsquo;ll spend 30 minutes each weekday instead of spending a few hours every week.</li>
<li><strong>Interleaving</strong>: each day&rsquo;s exercise isn&rsquo;t predictably themed because a bit of unpredictability can be <em>really</em> improve learning outcomes.</li>
<li><strong>Elaboration</strong>: your daily check-in isn&rsquo;t <em>just</em> about reflection: it&rsquo;s also a helpful learning tool!</li>
</ul>


<p>Plus, we&rsquo;ll be working through curriculum I&rsquo;ve been developing and iterating on for many years.
I have taught these topics in many different settings to folks from <em>many</em> different backgrounds.</p>

<h2>Form a daily learning habit 🔁</h2>

<p>Any 10-week program will be <em>just the start</em> of a Python learning habit.
You&rsquo;ll need to keep up your Python after Python High Five ends, either by promptly applying your skills to a new project or diving deeper into Python with continued daily practice.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m offering an <strong>80% discount</strong> for High Five attendees on one year of <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com">Python Morsels</a>, which is my skill-building service designed to help <strong>deepen your Python skills every week</strong>.
You can <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/high-five/#morsels">see more details on that here</a>.</p>

<h2>Ready to start your Python journey? ⛰️</h2>

<p>Are you ready to start your Python journey with a solid foundation?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/high-five/">Read more about Python High Five</a> and decide whether this is for you.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that while the program begins on September 9, <strong>enrollment closes on August 31</strong>.

    <link href="https://treyhunner.com/2024/08/find-the-datetime-format-code-for-your-date/"/>
    <updated>2024-08-05T11:30:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>https://treyhunner.com/2024/08/find-the-datetime-format-code-for-your-date</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I often find myself with a string representing a date and time and the need to create a format string that will parse this string into a <code>datetime</code> object.</p>

<p>I decided to make a tool that solves this problem for me: <a href="https://pym.dev/strptime">https://pym.dev/strptime</a></p>

<h2>Finding the code to parse a date format with <code>strptime</code></h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;m now using this new tool.</p>

<p>I find a date string in a random spreadsheet or log file that I need to parse.
For example, the string <code>30-Jun-2024 20:09</code>, which I recently found in a spreadsheet.</p>

<p>I then paste the string into the tool and watch the format appear:</p>

<p><a href="https://pym.dev/strptime"><img src="https://treyhunner.com/images/strptime-1.png"></a></p>

<p>Then I click on the date format to copy-paste it.
That&rsquo;s it!</p>

<p>This tool works by cycling through a number of common formats.
It also works for dates without a time, like <code>Jul 1, 2024</code>.</p>

<p><a href="https://pym.dev/strptime"><img src="https://treyhunner.com/images/strptime-2.png"></a></p>

<p>This input field works great when you&rsquo;re in need of a code for the <code>datetime</code> class&rsquo;s <code>strptime</code> method (which <em>parses</em> dates).
But what if you need a code for <code>strftime</code> (for <em>formatting</em> dates)?</p>

<h2>Finding the code to format a date with <code>strftime</code></h2>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t have a date but instead want to <em>construct</em> a date in a specific common format, scroll down the page a bit.</p>

<p>This page includes a table of common formats.</p>

<p><a href="https://pym.dev/strptime#formats"><img src="https://treyhunner.com/images/strptime-table.png"></a></p>

<p>Click on the format to copy it.
That&rsquo;s it.</p>

<h2>Playing with format codes</h2>

<p>What if you have a date format already but you&rsquo;re not sure what it represents?</p>

<p>Paste it in the box!</p>

<p>For example if you&rsquo;re wondering what the <code>%B</code> in <code>%B %d, %Y</code> means, paste it in to see what that represent with the current date and time:</p>

<p><a href="https://pym.dev/strptime"><img src="https://treyhunner.com/images/strptime-reverse.png"></a></p>

<h2>Other features</h2>

<p>There are a few other hidden features in this tool:</p>

<ul>
<li>After a date or date format is pasted, if it corresponds to one of the formats listed in the table of common formats, that row will be highlighted</li>
<li>Hitting the <code>Enter</code> key anywhere on the page will select the input field</li>
<li>Clicking on a date within the format table will fill that date into the input box</li>
<li>The bottom of the page includes links to other useful datetime formatting/parsing tools as well as a link to the relevant Python documentation</li>
</ul>


<h2>Thoughts? Feature requests?</h2>

<p>What do you think of this tool?</p>

<p>Is this something you&rsquo;d bookmark and use often?
Is this missing a key feature that you would need for it to be valuable for your use?</p>

<p>Are there date and time formats you&rsquo;d like to see that don&rsquo;t seem to be supported yet?</p>

<p>Comment or email me to let me know!</p>

<p>Have you ever used Python&rsquo;s <code>json.tool</code> command-line interface?</p>

<p>You can run <code>python -m json.tool</code> against a JSON file and Python will print a nicely formatted version of the file.</p>

<p>Why do we need to run <code>json.tool</code> instead of <code>json</code>?</p>

<h2>The history of <code>python -m</code></h2>

<p>Python 3.5 added the ability to run a module as a command-line script using the <code>-m</code> argument (see <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0338/">PEP 338</a>) which was implemented in Python 2.5.
While that feature was being an additional feature/bug was accidentally added, alowing packages to be run with the <code>-m</code> flag as well.
When a package was run with the <code>-m</code> flag, the package&rsquo;s <code>__init__.py</code> file would be run, with the <code>__name__</code> variable set to <code>__main__</code>.</p>

<p>This accidental feature/bug was <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/47000">removed in Python 2.6</a>.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until Python 2.7 that the ability to run <code>python -m package</code> was re-added (see below).</p>

<h2>The history of the <code>json</code> module</h2>

<p>The <code>json</code> module was <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/2.6.html#the-json-module-javascript-object-notation">added in Python 2.6</a>.
It was based on the third-party <code>simplejson</code> library.</p>

<p>That library originally relied on the fact that Python packages could be run with the <code>-m</code> flag to run the package&rsquo;s <code>__init__.py</code> file with <code>__name__</code> set to <code>__main__</code> (see <a href="https://github.com/simplejson/simplejson/blob/v1.8.1/simplejson/__init__.py#L368">this code from version 1.8.1</a>).</p>

<p>When <code>simplejson</code> was added to Python as the <code>json</code> module in Python 2.6, this bug/feature could no longer be relied upon as it was fixed in Python 2.6.
To continue allowing for a nice command-line interface, it was decided that running a <code>tool</code> submodule would be the way to add a command-line interface to the <code>json</code> package (<a href="https://github.com/simplejson/simplejson/commit/74d9c5c4c4339db47dfa86bf37858cae80ed3776">discussion here</a>).</p>

<p>Python 2.7 <a href="https://docs.python.org/2.7/using/cmdline.html?highlight=__main__#cmdoption-m">added the ability to run any package as a command-line tool</a>.
The package would simply need a <code>__main__.py</code> file within it, which Python would run as the entry point to the package.</p>

<p>At this point, <code>json.tool</code> had already been added in Python 2.6 and no attempt was made (as far as I can tell) to allow <code>python -m json</code> to work instead.
Once you&rsquo;ve added a feature, removing or changing it can be painful.</p>

<h2>Could we make <code>python -m json</code> work today?</h2>

<p>We could.
We would just need to <a href="https://github.com/treyhunner/cpython/commit/1226315e2df0d4229558734d5f0d50f1386a025e">rename <code>tool.py</code> to <code>__main__.py</code></a>.
To allow <code>json.tool</code> to still work <em>also</em>, would could <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/7ce95d21886c7ad5278c07c1a20cda5bebab4731">make a new <code>tool.py</code> module</a> that simply imports <code>json.__main__</code>.</p>

<p>We could even go so far as to <a href="https://github.com/treyhunner/cpython/commit/ae4ca62346c690e1c6aaf1ccfed37069984b5d67">deprecate <code>json.tool</code></a> if we wanted to.</p>

<p>Should we do this though? 🤔</p>

<h2>Should we make <code>python -m json</code> work?</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I would rather type <code>python -m json</code> than <code>python -m json.tool</code>.
It&rsquo;s more memorable <em>and</em> easier to guess, if you&rsquo;re not someone who has memorized <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/cli-tools/">all the command-line tools hiding in Python</a>.</p>

<p>But would this actually be used?
I mean, don&rsquo;t people just use the <a href="https://jqlang.github.io/jq/">jq</a> tool instead?</p>

<p>Well, a <code>sqlite3</code> shell was <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#command-line-interface">added to Python 3.12</a> despite the fact that third-party interactive sqlite prompts are fairly common.</p>

<p>It is pretty handy to have a access to a tool within an unfamiliar environment where installing yet-another-tool might pose a problem.
Think Docker, a locked-down Windows machine, or any computer without network or with network restrictions.</p>

<p>Personally, I&rsquo;d like to see <code>python3 -m json</code> work.
I can&rsquo;t think of any big downsides.
Can you?</p>

<h2>Too long; didn&rsquo;t read</h2>

<p>The &ldquo;too long didn&rsquo;t read version&rdquo;:</p>

<ul>
<li>Python 2.5 added support for the <code>-m</code> argument for <em>modules</em>, but not <em>packages</em></li>
<li>A third-party <code>simplejson</code> app existed with a nice CLI that relied on a <code>-m</code> implementation bug allowing packages to be run using <code>-m</code></li>
<li>Python 2.6 fixed that implementation quirk and broke the previous ability to run <code>python -m simplejson</code></li>
<li>Python 2.6 also added the <code>json</code> module, which was based on this third-party <code>simplejson</code> package</li>
<li>Since <code>python -m json</code> couldn&rsquo;t work anymore, the ability to run <code>python -m json.tool</code> was added</li>
<li>Python 2.7 added official support for <code>python -m some_package</code> by running a <code>__main__</code> submodule</li>
<li>The <code>json.tool</code> module already existed in Python 2.6 and the ability to run <code>python -m json</code> was (as far as I can tell) never seriously considered</li>
</ul>


<h2>All thanks to git history and issue trackers</h2>

<p>I discovered this by noting <a href="https://github.com/simplejson/simplejson/commit/74d9c5c4c4339db47dfa86bf37858cae80ed3776">the first commit</a> that added the <code>tool</code> submodule to <code>simplejson</code>, which notes the fact that this was for consistency with the new <code>json</code> standard library module.</p>

<p>Thank you git history.
And thank you to the folks who brought us the <code>simplejson</code> library, the <code>json</code> module, and the ability to use <code>-m</code> on both a module and a package!</p>

<p>Also, thank you to Alyssa Coghlan, Hugo van Kemenade, and Adam Turner for reviewing my pull request to add this feature to Python 3.14. 💖</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Creating performance tests for <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com">Python Morsels</a> exercises is a frequent annoyance</p>

<p>I loathe writing automated tests for performance-related exercises because they&rsquo;re <em>always</em> flaky.
How flaky depends on the exercise, what I&rsquo;m testing, and the time variability inherent in the particular Python features that a learner might use.</p>

<p>I came up with a solution for flaky tests recently, but it also makes my tests less readable.
I then came up with a tool to improve the readability, but that has its own trade-offs.</p>

<p>The code I eventually came up with is a <strong>beautiful Python monstrosity</strong>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll explain what that code does, but first let&rsquo;s talk about why it&rsquo;s needed.</p>

<p>The first block runs a performance test for the user&rsquo;s function on a very small list and on a slightly larger list and then asserting that the slightly larger list didn&rsquo;t take <em>too</em> much longer to run.
The next two blocks run the same code on even larger lists and make further assertions about the relative times that the code took to run.</p>

<p>This roughly approximates the <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/time-complexities/">time complexity</a> of this code.</p>

<h2>Running performance checks in a loop</h2>

<p>These performance checks need to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Predictably fail for inefficient solutions</li>
<li>Predictably pass for efficient solutions</li>
<li>Run <em>fast</em> (within just a few seconds) even when the code is inefficient</li>
<li>Avoid the use of <code>threading</code> because they&rsquo;ll be running on WebAssembly in the browser</li>
<li>Run consistently on pretty much any computer</li>
</ol>


<p>These 5 requirements together have caused me countless headaches.
I get the tests passing well, but they don&rsquo;t always fail when they should.
I get the tests failing and passing when they should, but then they&rsquo;re too slow.
And so on&hellip;</p>

<p>Notice the <code>n</code> and <code>m</code> factors in the above assertions:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">assertLess</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">small_time</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">micro_time</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">m</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If <code>n</code> and <code>m</code> are too big, we&rsquo;ll get false positives (tests passing when they should fail).
If <code>n</code> and <code>m</code> are too small, we&rsquo;ll get false negatives (tests failing when they should pass).</p>

<p>To avoid both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors">Type I and Type II errors</a>, I decided to keep <code>n</code> and <code>m</code> small but attempt the assertion block multiple times.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the (far less flaky) revised code:</p>

<p>The <code>for</code> loop runs the code multiple times, the <code>break</code> statement stops the code as soon as the assertions all pass, and the <code>except</code> and <code>if</code> ensure that any assertion errors are suppressed until/unless we&rsquo;re on the final iteration of the loop.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s call this a <code>for</code>-<code>try</code>-<code>break</code>-<code>except</code>-<code>if</code>-<code>raise</code> pattern.
It&rsquo;s an absurdly verbose name fitting of absurdly verbose code.</p>

<p>This <code>for</code>-<code>try</code>-<code>break</code>-<code>except</code>-<code>if</code>-<code>raise</code> pattern works pretty well!
But it&rsquo;s not pretty.</p>

<p>Like many programmers, I believe that <strong>Don&rsquo;t Repeat Yourself</strong> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a>) need not apply to tests.
Tests are <em>allowed</em> to be repetitive if <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6453235/what-does-damp-not-dry-mean-when-talking-about-unit-tests">the verbosity improves readability</a>.</p>

<p>But there is <em>so much noise</em> in that code!
I decided that removing some noise might improve readability.
So I devised a helper utility to reduce the repetition.</p>

<h2>In search of a solution</h2>

<p>While pondering the repetitive noise in this code, I wondered what Python features I could use to abstract away this <code>for</code>-<code>try</code>-<code>break</code>-<code>except</code>-<code>if</code>-<code>raise</code> pattern.</p>

<p>Could I make a context manager and use a <code>with</code> block?
That might help with the <code>try</code>-<code>except</code>, but context managers can&rsquo;t run their code block multiple times, so that wouldn&rsquo;t help with the <code>for</code> and the <code>break</code>.
So a context manager is out.</p>

<p>Could I abstract this away into a looping helper by implementing a generator function?
We <em>are</em> looping and generator functions <em>can</em> <code>break</code> early.
But, a generator function can&rsquo;t catch an exception that&rsquo;s raised within the <em>body</em> of a loop.
So a generator function wouldn&rsquo;t work either.</p>

<p>What about a decorator? 🤔</p>

<p>Context managers and decorators both sandwich a block of code.
But decorators sandwich functions and they have the power to run the same function <em>repeatedly</em>.
A decorator might work!</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a decorator that will run a given function up to 10 times (until no <code>AssertionError</code> is raised):</p>

<p>To use this decorator, we would need to define a function and then call that function:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">tiny_time</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">time</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">tiny_numbers</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">assertLess</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">tiny_time</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">micro_time</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">assertions</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This isn&rsquo;t <em>quite</em> good enough though&hellip;</p>

<ol>
<li>We need a pattern to run code N times (not necessarily exactly 10)</li>
<li>We reference the variables defined in each block in later blocks, so <code>micro_time</code> and <code>tiny_time</code> will need to be available <em>outside</em> that function</li>
<li>We need this function to run just one time right after it&rsquo;s defined&hellip; could we do that automatically?</li>
</ol>


<p>All 3 of these problems are solvable:</p>

<ol>
<li>We need a decorator that accepts arguments</li>
<li>We need to use <em>rarely seen</em> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/1261961/98187"><code>nonlocal</code></a> statement</li>
<li>We could have the decorator automatically call the decorated function</li>
</ol>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This decorator accepts an <code>n</code> argument which determines the maximum number of times the decorated function should be called.
The decorator then <em>calls</em> the function repeatedly in a <code>for</code> loop and a <code>try</code>-<code>except</code> block.
As soon as an <code>AssertionError</code> is <em>not</em> raised during one of these function calls, the looping stops.</p>

<p>The <em>weirdest</em> part about this decorator is that it calls the decorated function.
Note that the <code>decorator</code> function doesn&rsquo;t define a <code>wrapper</code> function within itself&hellip; it just runs code right away!</p>

<p>The <code>attempt_n_times</code> decorator <strong>immediately calls the function it decorates</strong>.
Each function is defined and immediately called one or more times, in a <code>try</code>-<code>except</code> block within a loop.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve named these functions with the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36315309/how-does-python-throw-away-variable-work">throwaway</a> <code>_</code> name: <strong>we don&rsquo;t care about the name of a function we&rsquo;re never going to refer to again</strong>.</p>

<p>Also note the use of the <code>nonlocal</code> statement.
Each function in Python has its own scope and all assignments <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/local-and-global-variables/#assigning-to-local-and-global-variables">assign to the local scope</a> by default.
That <code>nonlocal</code> variable pulls those variables to the scope of the outer function instead.</p>

<p>I find the refactored version easier to skim.</p>

<p>But that <code>attempt_n_times</code> decorator <em>does</em> abuse the decorator syntax.
Decorators aren&rsquo;t <em>meant</em> to call the function they&rsquo;re decorating.</p>

<p>Is this misuse of decorators worth it?</p>

<h2>Is this worth it?</h2>

<p>Decorators aren&rsquo;t supposed to immediately call the function they decorate.
But there&rsquo;s nothing stopping them from doing so.
I feel that I&rsquo;ve traded &ldquo;normal code&rdquo; for a beautiful monstrosity that&rsquo;s easier to skim at a glance.</p>

<p>The <code>attempt_n_times</code> decorator is pretending that it&rsquo;s a block-level tool by using a function because there&rsquo;s no other way to invent such a tool in Python.</p>

<p>I think abstracting away the <code>for</code>-<code>try</code>-<code>break</code>-<code>except</code>-<code>if</code>-<code>raise</code> pattern was worth it, even though I ended up abusing Python&rsquo;s decorator syntax in the process.</p>

<p>What do you think?
Was that <code>attempt_n_times</code> abstraction worth it?</p>

    <link href="https://treyhunner.com/2024/05/pycon-2024-reflection/"/>
    <updated>2024-05-28T13:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>https://treyhunner.com/2024/05/pycon-2024-reflection</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I traveled back home from PyCon US 2024 last week.
This is my reflection on my time at PyCon.</p>

<h2>Attempting to eat vegan</h2>

<p>Since 2020, I&rsquo;ve been <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/111794737871397453">gradually eating more plant-based</a> and <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/111982459215543497">a few months ago</a> I decided to take PyCon as an opportunity to attempt exclusively vegan eating outside my own home.
As <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/112493037289419028">I noted on Mastodon</a>, it was a challenge and I failed every day at least once but I found the experience worthwhile.
Our food system is <em>very</em> dairy-oriented.</p>

<h2>Staying hydrated and fed</h2>

<p>One of the first things I did before heading to the convention center was walk to Target and buy snacks and drinks.
When at PyCon, I prefer to spend 30 minutes and $20 to have a backup plan for last minute hydration and calories (even if not the <em>greatest</em> calories).
I never quite know when I might sleep through breakfast, find lunch lacking, or wish I&rsquo;d eaten more dinner.</p>

<h2>A tutorial, an orientation, a lightning talk, and open spaces</h2>

<p>My responsibilities at PyCon this year included teaching a tutorial and helping run the Newcomer&rsquo;s Orientation with <a href="https://x.com/KojoIdrissa">Kojo</a> and <a href="https://social.coop/@brainwane">Sumana</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/112479031063220835">Yngve and Marie</a> offered to act as teaching assistants during my tutorial and I was very grateful for their help!
<a href="https://x.com/mathsppblog">Rodrigo</a> and Krishna also offered to TA just before my tutorial started and I was extra grateful to have even more help than I&rsquo;d expected.
The attendees were mostly better prepared than I expected they would be, which was also great.
It&rsquo;s always great to spend less time on setup and more time exploring Python together.</p>

<p>The newcomer&rsquo;s orientation the next day went well.
We kept it fairly brief and were able to address about 10 minutes of audience questions before the opening reception started.</p>

<p>Once my PyCon responsibilities completed, I invented a few more (light) responsibilities for myself. 😅
I signed up to give a lightning talk on how to give a lightning talk.
They slotted it as the first talk of the first lightning talk session on Friday night.
I kept this talk pretty much the same as the one <a href="https://youtu.be/aNHBr7q-KVw?feature=shared&amp;t=915">I presented DjangoCon 2016</a>.
I could have made the transitions fancier, but I decided to embrace the idea of simplicity with the hope that audience members might think &ldquo;look if that first speaker can give such a simple and succinct presentation, maybe I can too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On Saturday I ran <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/112457077109815019">an open space on Python Learning</a>.
Some of you showed up because you&rsquo;re on my mailing list or you&rsquo;re paying Python Morsels subscribers.
Many folks showed up because the topic was interesting, either as a learner or as a teacher.
I really enjoyed the round-table-style conversation we had.</p>

<p>I also ran a <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/112468136603503893">Cabo Card game open space</a> during lunch on Sunday on the 4th floor rooftop.
Cabo is my usual conference ice breaker game and I played it at least a few nights <a href="https://mas.to/@davidism/112465501797531611">in The Westin lobby</a> as well.</p>

<h2>Seeing conference friends, old and new</h2>

<p>For me, PyCon is largely about having conversations.
The talks and tutorials are great for starting me thinking about an idea.
The hallway track, open spaces, and meals are great for continuing conversations about those ideas (or <em>other</em> ideas).</p>

<p>My first morning in Pittsburgh, I chatted with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/naomiceder/">Naomi</a> and <a href="https://x.com/reuvenmlerner/">Reuven</a>.
I&rsquo;m glad I ran into them before the conference kicked off because (as often happens at PyCon) I only very briefly saw either of them during the rest of PyCon!</p>

<p>After my tutorial that afternoon, I did dinner with Marie, Yngve, and Rodrigo at Rosewater Mediterranean (good vegan options, assuming you enjoy falafel and various sauces).
As sometimes happens at PyCon, another PyCon attendee, Sachin, joined our table because we noticed him eating on his own at a table near us and invited him to join us.</p>

<p>On Saturday, <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@melaniearbor">Melanie</a>, <a href="https://mas.to/@davidism">David</a>, <a href="https://x.com/kjaymiller">Jay</a>, and I had a sort of mini San Diego Python study group reunion dinner before inviting folks to join us for <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/112465503888730383">Cabo and Knucklebones</a> one night.
The 4 of us originally met each other (along with <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@willingc">Carol</a> and other wonderful Python folks) at the San Diego Python study group about 10 years ago.</p>

<p>I had some wonderful conversations about ways to improve the Python documentation over dinner (at Nicky&rsquo;s Thai) on Sunday night with <em>so</em> many docs-concerned folks who I highly respect.
I&rsquo;m really excited that Python has <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0732/">the documentation editorial board</a> and I&rsquo;m hopeful that that board, with the help of many others community members, will usher in big improvements to the documentation in the coming years.</p>

<p>I also met a number of Internet acquaintances IRL for the first time at PyCon.
I met <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tereza-iofciu/">Tereza</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessica0greene/">Jessica</a>, who I know from our work in the PSF Code of Conduct workgroup.
I met <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@slott56">Steve Lott</a>, who I originally knew as <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/10661/s-lott">a prolific question-answerer</a>.
I also met <a href="https://github.com/hugovk">Hugo</a>, a CPython core dev, the Python 3.14 &amp; 3.15 release manager, and a <a href="https://mastodon.social/@hugovk">social media user</a> (which is how I&rsquo;ve primarily interacted with him because the Internet is occasionally lovely).
I was also very excited to meet many <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com">Python Morsels members</a> as well as folks who know me through <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/newsletter/">my weekly Python tips newsletter</a>.</p>

<p>I was grateful to chat with <a href="https://mastodon.social/@hynek">Hynek</a> and <a href="https://mastodon.social/@AlSweigart">Al</a> about creating talks, YouTube videos, and other online content.
I also enjoyed chatting with <a href="https://mastodon.social/@glyph">Glyph</a> a bit about our experiences consulting and training and (in hindsight) wished I&rsquo;d planned an open space for either consultants or trainers, both of which have been held at PyCon before but it just takes someone to stick it on the open space board.</p>

<p>Many folks I only saw very briefly (I said a quick hi and bye to <a href="https://aeracode.org/@andrew">Andrew</a> over lunch during the sprints) and some I didn&rsquo;t see at all (<a href="https://mastodon.social/@frank@frankwiles.social">Frank</a> was at PyCon but we never ran into each other).
Some I essentially saw through playing a few rounds of Cabo (<a href="https://social.coop/@Yhg1s">Thomas</a> and <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@ethantyping">Ethan</a> among many others).
We also ran into at least 4 other PyCon attendees in the airport on Tuesday afternoon, including <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bbelderbos/">Bob</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliansequeira/">Julian</a>, who it&rsquo;s always a pleasure to see.</p>

<h2>A Mastodon-oriented PyCon</h2>

<p>On Thursday night I had the feeling that the number of Mastodon posts I saw on the <strong>#PyConUS</strong> hashtag was greater than the number of Twitter posts.
I (very unscientifically) counted up the number of posts I was seeing on each and found that my perception was correct: <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/112453920848761679">Mastodon seemed to slightly overtake Twitter at PyCon this year</a>.</p>

<p>Over dinner on Wednesday, I tried to convince Marie, Yngve, and Rodrigo to get Mastodon accounts just to follow the hashtag during PyCon.
I succeeded: <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/112479031063220835">Marie and Yngve</a> and <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@davep/112458736212760528">Rodrigo</a>!</p>

<p>Mastodon will never be <em>the</em> social media platform.
Its decentralized nature is too much of a barrier for many folks.
However, it does seem to be used by <em>enough</em> somewhat nerdy Python folks to now be one the most used social media platform for PyCon posting.</p>

<h2>The talks</h2>

<p>I ended up spending little time in the talks during PyCon.
This wasn&rsquo;t on purpose.
I just happened to attend many open spaces, take personal breaks, and end up in hallway conversations often.
I did see many of the lightning talks live, as well as <a href="https://x.com/kjaymiller">Jay</a>, <a href="https://simonwillison.net/@simon">Simon</a>, and <a href="https://social.coop/@brainwane">Sumana</a>&rsquo;s keynotes (all of them were exceptional) and the opening and closing remarks.
I also watched a few talks from my hotel room while taking breaks.</p>

<p>While I&rsquo;m often a bit light on my talk load at PyCon, I do recommend folks attend a good handful of live talks during PyCon, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@jonafato/112514979873634457">as Jon</a> and <a href="https://hynek.me/articles/hallway-track/">others</a> recommend.
I wish I had seen more talks live.
I also wish I had attended a few open spaces that I missed.</p>

<p>At any one time, I know that I&rsquo;m always missing about 90% of what&rsquo;s scheduled during PyCon (if you include the talks <em>and</em> the open spaces).
That&rsquo;s assuming I don&rsquo;t ditch the conference entirely for a few hours and <a href="https://social.coop/@bitprophet/112452662184950234">walk across a bridge</a> or <a href="https://mastodon.social/@AlSweigart/112514009252817862">ride a funicular</a> (neither of which I did, as I stuck around the venue the whole time this year).
I am glad I saw, did, and talked about everything I did, but there&rsquo;s always something I wish I&rsquo;d seen/done!</p>

<h2>The sprints</h2>

<p>Thanks to the documentation dinner, I had a couple documentation-related ideas in mind on the first day of sprints.
But I&rsquo;m also <em>really</em> excited about the new Python REPL coming in Python 3.13 (<a href="https://x.com/treyhunner/status/1720185049461801371">in case</a> you <a href="https://treyhunner.com/2024/05/installing-a-custom-python-build-with-pyenv/">can&rsquo;t tell</a> from <a href="https://treyhunner.com/2024/05/my-favorite-python-3-dot-13-feature/">how much</a> I <a href="https://x.com/treyhunner/status/1788307498715554160">talk</a> about <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/treyhunner_python-activity-7194082747315859456-qQjk/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">it</a>), so I sprinted on that instead.
<a href="https://github.com/ambv">Łukasz</a> assigned me the task of researching keyboard shortcuts that the new REPL is missing (compared to the current one on Linux and Mac) so <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/119034#issuecomment-2121142576">I spent some time researching that</a>.
I got to see the REPL running on <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@tonybaloney/112477098396842900">Anthony&rsquo;s laptop</a> on Windows and I am <em>so excited</em> that Windows support will be included before 3.13.0 lands! 🎉</p>

<p>Partly inspired by <a href="https://youtu.be/RL3HFj5SDqI?t=1549">Carol Willing&rsquo;s PyCon preview message</a>, I also thanked <a href="https://github.com/pablogsal">Pablo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ambv">Łukasz</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/lysnikolaou">Lysandros</a> in-person for all their work on the new Python REPL. 🤗</p>

<h2>Until next year</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be <a href="https://www.pyohio.org/2024/program/speakers/keynote-speakers/#trey-hunner">keynoting at PyOhio</a> this year.</p>

<p>Besides PyOhio, I&rsquo;m not sure whether I&rsquo;ll make it to another conference until PyCon US next year.
I&rsquo;d love to attend all of them, but I do have work and personal goals that need accomplishing too!</p>

<p>I hope to see you at PyCon US 2025!
In the meantime, if you&rsquo;re wishing we&rsquo;d exchanged contact details or met in-person, please feel free to stay in touch through <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner">Mastodon</a>, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://pym.dev/newsletter">my weekly emails</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PythonMorsels">YouTube</a>, or <a href="http://twitter.com/treyhunner">Twitter</a>.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[The new REPL in Python 3.13]]></title>
    <link href="https://treyhunner.com/2024/05/my-favorite-python-3-dot-13-feature/"/>
    <updated>2024-05-08T13:30:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>https://treyhunner.com/2024/05/my-favorite-python-3-dot-13-feature</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Python 3.13 just hit feature freeze with <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3130b1/">the first beta release today</a>.</p>

<p>Just before the feature freeze, a shiny new feature was added: <strong>a brand new Python REPL</strong>. ✨</p>

<p>This new Python REPL is the feature I&rsquo;m most looking forward to using while teaching after 3.13.0 final is released later this year.
In terms of improving my quality of life while teaching Python, this new REPL may be my favorite feature since f-strings were added in Python 3.6.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to share what&rsquo;s so great about this new REPL and what additional improvements I&rsquo;m hoping we might see in future Python releases.</p>

<p>None of these features will be ground breaking for folks who are already using <a href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython">IPython</a> day-to-day.
This new REPL really shines when you can&rsquo;t or shouldn&rsquo;t install PyPI packages (as when teaching a brand new Pythonistas in a locked-down corporate environment).</p>

<h2>Little niceties</h2>

<p>The first thing you&rsquo;ll notice when you launch the new REPL is the colored prompt.</p>

<p><img src="https://treyhunner.com/images/new-repl-intro.gif"></p>

<p>You may also notice that as you type a block of code, after the first indented line, the next line will be auto-indented!
Additionally, hitting the Tab key inserts 4 spaces now, which means there&rsquo;s no more need to ever hit <code>Space Space Space Space</code> to indent ever again.</p>

<p>At this point you might be thinking, &ldquo;wait did I accidentally launch ptpython or some other alternate REPL?&rdquo;
But it gets even better!</p>

<h2>You can &ldquo;exit&rdquo; now</h2>

<p>Have you ever typed <code>exit</code> at the Python REPL?
If so, you&rsquo;ve seen a message like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='pycon'><span class='line'><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="nb">exit</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="go">Use exit() or Ctrl-D (i.e. EOF) to exit</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>That feels a bit silly, doesn&rsquo;t it?
Well, typing <code>exit</code> will exit immediately.</p>

<p><img src="https://treyhunner.com/images/new-repl-exit.gif"></p>

<p>Typing <code>help</code> also enters help mode now (previously you needed to call <code>help()</code> as a function).</p>

<h2>Block-level history</h2>

<p>The feature that will make the biggest different in my own usage of the Python REPL is block-level history.</p>

<p><img src="https://treyhunner.com/images/new-repl-block.gif"></p>

<p>I make typos all the time while teaching.
I also often want to re-run a specific block of code with a couple small changes.</p>

<p>The old-style Python REPL stores history line-by-line.
So editing a block of code in the old REPL required hitting the up arrow many times, hitting Enter, hitting the up arrow many more times, hitting Enter, etc. until each line in a block was chosen.
At the same time you also needed to make sure to edit your changes along the way&hellip; or you&rsquo;ll end up re-running the same block with the same typo as before!</p>

<p>The ability to edit a previously typed <em>block</em> of code is huge for me.
For certain sections of my Python curriculum, I hop into <a href="https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/ptpython">ptpython</a> or <a href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython">IPython</a> specifically for this feature.
Now I&rsquo;ll be able to use the default Python REPL instead.</p>

<h2>Pasting code <em>just works</em></h2>

<p>The next big feature for me is the ability to paste code.</p>

<p>Check this out:</p>

<p><img src="https://treyhunner.com/images/new-repl-paste.gif"></p>

<p>Not impressed?
Well, watch what happens when we paste that same block of code into the old Python REPL:</p>

<p><img src="https://treyhunner.com/images/old-repl-paste.gif"></p>

<p>The old REPL treated pasted text the same as manually typed text.
When two consecutive newlines were encountered in the old REPL, it would end the current block of code because it assumed the Enter key had been pressed twice.</p>

<p>The new REPL supports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracketed-paste">bracketed paste</a>, which is was invented in 2002 and has since been adopted by all modern terminal emulators.</p>

<h2>No Windows support? Curses!</h2>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: This whole section is now irrelevant!
During the PyCon US sprints in late May 2024, the <code>readline</code> and <code>curses</code> dependencies were removed and <a href="https://mastodon.social/@tonybaloney@fosstodon.org/112477098540793635">Windows support</a> will be included in the second beta release of Python 3.13.0! 🎉</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this new REPL <strike>doesn&rsquo;t currently work on Windows</strike>.
This new REPL relies on the <code>curses</code> and <code>readline</code> modules, neither of which are available on Windows.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://pym.dev/repl">in-browser Python REPL</a> on Python Morsels also won&rsquo;t be able to use the new REPL because readline and curses aren&rsquo;t available in the WebAssembly Python build.</p>

<h2>Beta test Python 3.13 to try out the new REPL 💖</h2>

<p>Huge thanks to Pablo Galindo Salgado, Łukasz Langa, and Lysandros Nikolaou <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/whatsnew/3.13.html">for implementing this new feature</a>!
And thanks to Michael Hudson-Doyle and Armin Rigo for implementing the original version of this REPL, which was <a href="https://github.com/pypy/pyrepl">heavily borrowed from PyPy&rsquo;s pyrepl project</a>.</p>

<p>The new Python REPL coming in 3.13 is a major improvement over the old REPL.</p>

<p>Want to try out this new REPL?
Download and install <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3130b1/">Python 3.13.0 beta 1</a>!</p>

<p>Beta testing new Python releases helps the Python core team ensure the final release of 3.13.0 is as stable and functional as possible.
If you notice a bug, <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues">check the issue tracker</a> to see if it&rsquo;s been reported yet and if not report it!</p>

    <link href="https://treyhunner.com/2024/05/installing-a-custom-python-build-with-pyenv/"/>
    <updated>2024-05-03T21:26:23-07:00</updated>
    <id>https://treyhunner.com/2024/05/installing-a-custom-python-build-with-pyenv</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am <em>so</em> excited about the new Python REPL that will <em>likely</em> land in Python 3.13.
I&rsquo;ve been following <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/111567">this CPython pull request</a> since I heard <a href="https://github.com/pablogsal">Pablo</a> and <a href="https://lukasz.langa.pl">Łukasz</a> announce their work on the new Python REPL <a href="https://twitter.com/treyhunner/status/1720186574032531780">in episode 1</a> of their new <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/core-py/id1712665877">core.py podcast</a>.</p>

<h2>Github notifications? 🤔</h2>

<p>That pull request was quiet for many months, but in the last couple weeks, I started seeing email notifications in my inbox about it.
I&rsquo;ve never fancied myself a competent C developer and I try to steer clear from understanding TTY magic, so I have <em>no idea</em> what most of the commits do.
But seeing activity on this pull request rejuvenated my excitement about this upcoming feature!</p>

<p>I also remember reading that the Python 3.13 feature freeze is coming up soon, so I&rsquo;ve been silently cheering for that PR to make the cut before the deadline.</p>

<p>In the last few days, I decided that I should try committing to use this new REPL locally as my default Python environment.
When I type <code>python</code> on my machine, I want to live in this new shiny REPL.
I figure this will make it easier to spot bugs that might not have been noticed yet&hellip; though honestly it&rsquo;ll mostly just allow me to try out this fancy new REPL first-hand.</p>

<h2>Installing a custom CPython build in pyenv</h2>

<p>I use pyenv to manage the many Python versions I have installed on my machine.
I wondered whether it was possible to install a custom build of CPython with pyenv.</p>

<p>Instead of going to the pyenv documentation to figure out an answer, I argued with an AI until it gave me a working answer.
I tried a few AI systems at first, but Claude seemed to give me the most promising-looking answer so it was the one I argued with for 5-10 minutes until I got a working solution.</p>

<p>First, I created this <code>~/.pyenv/plugins/python-build/share/python-build/3.13.0-pyrepl</code> file:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>prefer_openssl11
</span><span class='line'>export PYTHON_BUILD_CONFIGURE_WITH_OPENSSL=1
</span><span class='line'>install_package "pyrepl" "https://github.com/pablogsal/cpython/archive/pyrepl.tar.gz" standard verify_py39 ensurepip</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then I ran this command, which took a couple minutes:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>pyenv install 3.13.0-pyrepl
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>After that, <code>pyenv versions</code> showed a new <code>3.13.0-pyrepl</code> version:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>pyenv versions
</span><span class='line'>  system
</span><span class='line'>* 3.8.18 <span class="o">(</span><span class="nb">set </span>by /home/trey/.pyenv/version<span class="o">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>* 3.9.18 <span class="o">(</span><span class="nb">set </span>by /home/trey/.pyenv/version<span class="o">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>* 3.10.13 <span class="o">(</span><span class="nb">set </span>by /home/trey/.pyenv/version<span class="o">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>* 3.11.6 <span class="o">(</span><span class="nb">set </span>by /home/trey/.pyenv/version<span class="o">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>* 3.12.0 <span class="o">(</span><span class="nb">set </span>by /home/trey/.pyenv/version<span class="o">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>  3.13.0-pyrepl
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I then added <code>3.13.0-pyrepl</code> to the top of my <code>~/.pyenv/version</code> file to make this my <em>default</em> Python:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>3.13.0-pyrepl
</span><span class='line'>3.12.0
</span><span class='line'>3.11.6
</span><span class='line'>3.10.13
</span><span class='line'>3.9.18
</span><span class='line'>3.8.18
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And it worked!
Tying <code>python</code> showed the new colorful prompt.</p>

<p>Is is a bad idea to make this not-even-beta version of CPython the default Python on my machine?
I have no idea.
Everything&rsquo;s been fine for the last 10 hours at least&hellip; 🤷</p>

<p>If you ever need to try installing a custom CPython build with pyenv, maybe the above instructions will work.
They&rsquo;re mostly generated by a large language model that didn&rsquo;t give me a working answer until the third response&hellip; so feel free to let me know if it&rsquo;s all wrong (or all right?).</p>

<p>After this adventure, I checked my podcast feed this evening only to realize that there&rsquo;s <a href="https://mastodon.social/@ambv/112378026608575109">a new core.py episode</a> all about exactly this feature!
If you&rsquo;d like to hear some core developers nerd out about CPython development, give core.py a listen.
You don&rsquo;t need to understand how CPython development works to enjoy their enthusiasm. 💖</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>10 years and 10 days ago I flew home from my very first Python conference.</p>

<p>I left a few days into the PyCon US 2014 sprints and I remember feeling a bit like summer camp was ending.
I&rsquo;d played board games, contributed to an open source project, seen tons of talks, and met a <em>ton</em> of people.</p>

<h2>My first Python conference: PyCon US 2014</h2>

<p>PyCon 2014 was the first Python conference I attended.</p>

<p>At the start of the conference I only knew a handful of San Diegans.
I left having met many more folks.
Some of the folks I met I knew from online forums, GitHub repos, or videos
I met Kenneth Love, Baptiste Mispelon, Carl Meyer, Eric Holscher in-person, among many others.
Most folks I met I had never encountered online, but I was glad to have met in person.</p>

<p>For the most part, I had no idea who anyone was, what they did with Python, or what they might be interested in talking about.
I also had no idea what most of the various non-talk activities were.
I found out about the Education Summit and hadn&rsquo;t realized that it required pre-registration.
The open spaces are one of my favorite parts of PyCon and I didn&rsquo;t even they existed until PyCon 2015.</p>

<p>I <em>did</em> stay for a couple days of the sprints and I was grateful for that.
Most of the memorable human connections I had were during the sprints.
I helped <a href="https://pyvideo.org">PyVideo</a> upgrade their code base from Python 2 to Python 3 (this was before Will and Sheila <a href="https://pyvideo.org/pages/thanks-will-and-sheila.html">stepped down as maintainers</a>).
Will guided me through the code base and seemed grateful for the help.</p>

<p>I also got the idea to write front-end JavaScript tests for Django during the sprints and eventually <a href="https://github.com/django/deps/blob/main/final/0003-javascript-tests.rst">started that process</a> after PyCon thanks to Carl Meyer&rsquo;s guidance.</p>

<h2>Attending regional conferences and DjangoCon</h2>

<p>In fall 2014, I attended Django BarCamp at the Eventbrite office.
That was my first exposure to the idea of an &ldquo;unconference&rdquo;&hellip; which I kept in mind when I spotted the open spaces board at PyCon 2015.</p>

<p>Before coming back to Montreal for <a href="https://twitter.com/treyhunner/status/585969805796212736">PyCon 2015</a>, I emailed Harry Percival to ask if he could use a teaching assistant during his tutorial on writing tests. His reply was much more enthusiastic than I expected: &ldquo;YES YES OH GOD YES THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU TREY&rdquo;.
I was very honored to be able to help Harry, as my testing workflow was <em>heavily</em> inspired by many blog posts he&rsquo;d written about testing best practices in Django.</p>

<p>I coached at my first Django Girls event in 2015 in Ensenada and then my second at <a href="https://twitter.com/algosuna/status/641421944005378048">DjangoCon 2015</a> in Austin. I gave my first lightning talk at DjangoCon 2015, comparing modern JavaScript to Python. It was a lightning talk I had given at the San Diego JavaScript and <a href="https://www.sandiegopython.org">San Diego Python</a> meetups.</p>

<p>In 2016, I attended PyTennessee in Nashville. I remember attending a dinner of of about a dozen folks who spoke at the conference. I was grateful to get to chat with so many folks whose talks I&rsquo;d attended.</p>

<h2>Presenting talks and tutorials</h2>

<p>I presented my first conference tutorial at <a href="https://twitter.com/treyhunner/status/737069721292439552">PyCon 2016</a> in Portland and <a href="https://pyvideo.org/djangocon-us-2016/readability-counts.html">my first talk</a> at <a href="https://twitter.com/asendecka/status/756851845012844544">DjangoCon US 2016</a> in Philadelphia.
I had been presenting lightning talks every few months at my local Python and JavaScript meetups for a few years by then and I had hosted free workshops at my local meetup and paid workshops for training clients.</p>

<p>Having presented locally helped, but presenting on a big stage is always scary.</p>

<h2>Volunteering</h2>

<p>I volunteered at some of my first few conferences and found that I really enjoyed it.
I especially enjoyed running the registration desk, as you&rsquo;re often the first helpful face that people see coming into the conference.</p>

<p>During PyCon 2016, 2017, and 2018, I co-chaired the open spaces thanks to Anna Ossowski inviting me to help.
I had first attended open spaces during PyCon 2015 and I <em>loved</em> them.
Talks are great, but so are discussions!</p>

<p>I also ran for the PSF board of directors in 2016 and ended up serving on the board for a few years before stepping down.
After my board terms, I volunteered for the PSF Code of Conduct working group for about 6 years.
I didn&rsquo;t even know what the PSF <em>was</em> until PyCon 2015!</p>

<h2>A <em>lot</em> of travel&hellip; maybe too much</h2>

<p>After DjangoCon 2016, I went a bit conference-wild.
I attended <a href="https://twitter.com/treyhunner/status/829412120370565120">PyTennessee 2017</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/PythonChat/status/845052805375295488">PyCaribbean 2017</a> in Puerto Rico, <a href="https://twitter.com/loooorenanicole/status/866382369619562496">PyCon US 2017</a> in Portland, <a href="https://twitter.com/asteracode/status/893274761727361024">PyCon Australia 2017</a> in Melbourne, <a href="https://twitter.com/TobiasMcNulty/status/896570680933703681">DjangoCon 2017</a> in Spokane, <a href="https://twitter.com/treyhunner/status/916890505157468160">PyGotham 2017</a> in NYC, and <a href="https://twitter.com/treyhunner/status/937441419966296064">North Bay Python 2017</a> in Petaluma.</p>

<p>In 2018 I sponsored <a href="https://twitter.com/treyhunner/status/962862235734495232">PyTennessee</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jmwatt3/status/1023713820752183296">PyOhio</a> and spoke at both.
I passed out chocolate chip cookies at PyTennessee as a way to announce the launch of <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com">Python Morsels</a>.
I also attended <a href="https://twitter.com/treyhunner/status/996881842820272128">PyCon 2018</a> in Cleveland, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/144080672@N05/31764542868/">DjangoCon 2018</a> in San Diego, <a href="https://twitter.com/treyhunner/status/1048340952451047425">PyGotham 2018</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/nnja/status/1058589935618318336">North Bay Python 2018</a>.</p>

<p>I slowed down <em>a bit</em> in 2019, with just <a href="https://twitter.com/LaylaSells_cshs/status/1100058649227972609">PyCascades</a> (Seattle), <a href="https://twitter.com/mariatta/status/1125534406851084288">PyCon US</a> (Cleveland), <a href="https://twitter.com/juliansequeira/status/1157106403598749698">PyCon Australia</a> (Sydney), and DjangoCon US (San Diego, which is home for me).</p>

<h2>Since the pandemic</h2>

<p>Since the start of the pandemic, I&rsquo;ve attended <a href="https://twitter.com/treyhunner/status/1519724687890128899">PyCon US 2022</a>, DjangoCon 2022 in San Diego (in my city for the <em>third</em> time!) and <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/110243968672457367">PyCon US 2023</a>.
Traveling is more challenging for me than it used to be, but I hope to attend more regional conferences again soon.</p>

<p>Between client work, I&rsquo;ve been focusing less on conferences and more on blog posts (<a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/articles/">over here</a>), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PythonMorsels">screencasts</a>, my <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/newsletter/">weekly Python tips</a> emails, and (of course) on <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com">Python Morsels</a>.</p>

<h2>My journey started locally</h2>

<p>I became part of the Python community before I knew I was part of it.</p>

<p>I started using Python professionally in December 2009 and I attended my first San Diego Python meetup in March 2012.
I met the organizers, gave some lightning talks, attended Saturday study group sessions (thanks Carol Willing, Alain Domissy, and others for running these), and volunteered to help organize meetups, study groups, and workshops.</p>

<p>By 2014, I had learned from folks online and in-person and I had helped out at my local Python meetup.
I had even made a few contributions to some small Django packages I relied on heavily.</p>

<p>I was encouraged to attend PyCon 2014 by others who were attending (thanks Carol, Micah, and Paul among others).
The conference was well-worth the occasional feeling of overwhelm.</p>

<h2>We&rsquo;re all just people</h2>

<p>The biggest thing I&rsquo;ve repeatedly learned over the past decade of Python conferences is that we&rsquo;re all just people.</p>

<p>Carol Willing keynoted PyCon US 2023.
But I met Carol as a kind Python user in San Diego who started the first Python study group meetings in Pangea Bakery on Convoy Street.</p>

<p>Jay Miller will be keynoting PyCon US 2024.
But I met Jay as an attendee of the Python study group, who was enthusiastic about both learning and teaching others.</p>

<p>My partner, Melanie Arbor, keynoted DjangoCon 2022 along with Jay Miller.
When I met Melanie, she was new to Python and was very eager to both learn and help others.</p>

<p>David Lord has made a huge impact on the maintenance of Flask and other Pallets projects.
I met David as a Python study group attendee who was an enthusiastic StackOverflow contributor.</p>

<p>I learned a ton from Brandon Rhodes, Ned Batchelder, Russell Keith-Magee, and many others from online videos, forums, and open source projects before I ever met them.
But each of them are also just Python-loving people like the rest of us.
Russell gives good hugs, Ned is an organizer of his local Python meetup, and Brandon wears the same brand of shoes as me.</p>

<p>We all have people we&rsquo;ve learned from, we suffer from feelings of inadequacy, we get grumpy sometimes, and we care about the Python language and community in big and small ways.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s next for you?</h2>

<p>Will you attend a local meetup?
Or will you attend an online social event?</p>

<p>If so, consider asking the organize if you can present a 5 minute lightning talk at a future event.
As I <a href="https://youtu.be/aNHBr7q-KVw?si=Fryj6Ez4Cw7q-RAq">noted in a DjangoCon 2016 lightning talk</a>, lightning talks are a great way to connect with folks.</p>

<p>Will you attend a Python conference one day?
See <a href="https://treyhunner.com/2018/04/how-to-make-the-most-of-your-first-pycon/">having a great first PyCon</a> when/if you do.</p>

<p>Remember that we&rsquo;re all just people though.
Some may have a bit more experience (whether at speaking, contributing to open source, or something else), but we&rsquo;re just people.</p>
