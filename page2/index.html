  <div class="entry-content"><p>I launched a weekly Python skill-building service earlier this year called <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/">Python Morsels</a>.
This week I&rsquo;m running my first sale, which will also likely be the biggest sale that I run on Python Morsels for the foreseeable future (I don&rsquo;t want to say forever, but probably forever).</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re an experienced programmer and you feel like your Python code could be <em>more Pythonic</em>, <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/">Python Morsels</a> is for you.</p>

<p>Before I jump into details, let me explain what Python Morsels is.</p>

<h2>The inspiration</h2>

<p>I do on-site Python training for teams, which means I work with a lot of developers at a lot of companies.
One question I hear all the time is &ldquo;how can I make my code more Pythonic&rdquo;?</p>

<p>Most of the folks I teach are not new to programming and they&rsquo;re usually not new to Python either, but they also aren&rsquo;t experienced at leveraging the features and idioms that make Python unique.
Being a skilled programmer isn&rsquo;t the same as being a skilled <em>Python</em> programmer</p>

<p>Late last year this conundrum inspired me to create <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/">Python Morsels</a>.</p>

<h2>Learning by doing</h2>

<p>My training courses and workshops are exercise-driven and I find an exercise-heavy style of teaching very effective.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t learn by putting information into your head, <strong>you learn by trying to retrieve information from your head</strong>.
You can watch talks and read books and read code, but you&rsquo;ll absorb very little unless you <em>apply</em> what you&rsquo;ve learned.
You learn by doing, which means writing Python code.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why Python Morsels is entirely about writing code and reflecting on the code you&rsquo;ve written.</p>

<h2>Python Morsels: exercise-driven learning</h2>

<p>After you sign up for Python Morsels I&rsquo;ll send you <strong>one exercise every week</strong>.
Not an interview questions: a realistic Python exercise inspired by the interesting problems I&rsquo;ve had to solve in the past. The purpose of these exercises is to <strong>inspire you to learn something new about Python each week</strong>.</p>

<p>Each exercise includes a number of bonuses so you can <strong>choose your own difficulty level</strong>.
All exercises also include automated tests so you can test your code quickly.
After you&rsquo;ve solved the exercise I&rsquo;ll send you a number of different solutions to the problem with a discussion about why we might choose one solution over another.
These solutions are meant to help you <strong>reconsider the way you write your code</strong>.</p>

<p>While solving the bonuses is important, the more important thing is that you <strong>get into the habit of time-boxed weekly learning</strong>. You want to spend your time effectively and the best way to do that is to <strong>form a learning habit</strong> and time box that habit.
I suggest that you dedicate 30 minutes every week to solving the exercise, regardless of the difficulty level you choose, as well as 30 minutes to reflecting on the solutions email I send you.</p>

<h2>So how much is this sale for?</h2>

<p>Python Morsels normally costs $16/month (or $160/year on the annual plan).</p>

<p>From now until Monday I&rsquo;m offering a 40% discount off the annual plan, which means you&rsquo;ll get <strong>52 weeks of Python skill-building for $96</strong>.
That&rsquo;s effectively $8/month or <strong>a 50% discount</strong> when compared to the monthly subscription.</p>

<p>I say &ldquo;52 weeks&rdquo; instead of 1 year because Python Morsels subscriptions can be &ldquo;paused&rdquo; at any time, which allows for breaks during vacations and busy periods and ensures you&rsquo;ll get all of the 52 weeks you signed up for.</p>

<p>To take advantage of this discount you&rsquo;ll need to sign up for <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/">Python Morsels</a>, verify your email address, go to the Account page, and click the Subscribe button for the <strong>52 Week Plan</strong>.
The BLACKFRIDAY discount code should be automatically applied from now until the end of the sale on Monday.</p>

<h2>Money back guarantee</h2>

<p>This is the first sale I&rsquo;ve ever held so I&rsquo;m not sure whether it&rsquo;s common to offer a guarantee on sales, but I&rsquo;m going to do it for this one because I&rsquo;m pretty confident in what I&rsquo;m offering.</p>

<p>If you contact me with concerns but I can&rsquo;t find something that works for your needs, I&rsquo;ll send you a full refund.
I want you to improve your Python skills, but I don&rsquo;t want you signing up for something that isn&rsquo;t for you.
If you end up signing up for Python Morsels and you don&rsquo;t improve your Python skills because of it, <strong>you deserve a refund because I&rsquo;ve wasted your time</strong>.</p>

<h2>What do the first 52 weeks of Python Morsels exercises cover?</h2>

<p>Python Morsels starts small, but the exercises increase in difficulty over time.
The first 52 weeks of Python exercises will wander into <strong>a lot of interesting topics</strong>.</p>

<p>Within one year we&rsquo;ll:</p>

<ul>
<li>work with and create our own iterators (both generators and iterator classes)</li>
<li>make text-parsing programs and command-line programs</li>
<li>talk a lot about readability and code style</li>
<li>dive into a number of the built-ins and standard library modules</li>
<li>use operator overloading to make classes that support arithmetic</li>
<li>create our context managers</li>
<li>create our own decorators</li>
<li>use properties and descriptors and even <strong>make our own descriptor</strong></li>
<li>create custom collections (mappings, sequences, strings, sets, etc.)</li>
</ul>


<p>Haven&rsquo;t made a descriptor before?
By this time next year you will have!</p>

<h2>The sale ends on Monday</h2>

<p>This sale will ends on <strong>Monday November 26</strong>, end of day.</p>

<p>To get an effective 50% discount on Python Morsels over the next 52 weeks, <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/signup/">sign up to Python Morsels</a>, verify your email, go to the Account page, and subscribe to the <strong>52 Week Plan</strong>.</p>

<h2>Share this sale with friends and family</h2>

<p>If you have a friend or colleague who might benefit from weekly Python practice, let them know about this sale!
The BLACKFRIDAY coupon expires on Monday, but there&rsquo;s no limit on the number of signups, so there&rsquo;s no reason to keep this sale a secret.</p>

<p>So please share this email or the discount code with anyone you know who might find value in 52 weeks of Python skill-building.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<p>These are questions that I&rsquo;ve been asked at least once (that&rsquo;s apparently what &ldquo;frequently&rdquo; means now).</p>

<h4>Is this for someone who is brand new to programming?</h4>

<p>No, it isn&rsquo;t.
Python Morsels is for someone who has been using Python for a while and wants to improve their Python coding practices.
Many of the folks currently signed up write primarily Python code, but have a background in at least one other programming language.
However, there are a handful of folks who are signed up who would call Python their first and only programming language and I do try to accommodate folks in that camp as much as I can.</p>

<p>In general, I recommend Python Morsels for <strong>folks who are currently writing Python code regularly</strong>.</p>

<h4>How is Python Morsels different from a Python course?</h4>

<p>During my on-site trainings I&rsquo;m present as a live instructor and coach.
That&rsquo;s something you won&rsquo;t get from Python Morsels.
During online courses there are videos explaining each topic before it&rsquo;s practiced.
Python Morsels also doesn&rsquo;t have that.</p>

<p>The focus of Python Morsels is a bit different than a course or a training.
If you think of Python course as like taking a tennis class, Python Morsels is more like <strong>weekly tennis practice</strong>.
A Python Morsels subscriber described it to me as <strong>like Hannon&rsquo;s finger exercises for piano or Kreutzer&rsquo;s études for violin</strong>.
Python Morsels is guided <strong>deliberate practice</strong> in the domain of writing readable and maintainable Python code.</p>

<h4>How much time does this require each week?</h4>

<p>I expect that you&rsquo;ll spend <strong>about an hour each week on Python Morsels in total</strong>.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re a busy person who has production code to write and I don&rsquo;t want to waste your time.
The exercise includes bonuses, but I don&rsquo;t expect you to solve them all each week: instead I want you to time box yourself.
I recommend that you set aside 30 minutes to solve the problem each week, including running the tests and solving as many bonuses as you can.
I&rsquo;d also like you to set aside 30 minutes to reflect on your code while reading the solution email I send each week.
I often link to related resources to read/watch, but I&rsquo;d like you to bookmark those for later.</p>

<p>If you have more than one hour to devote each week, you could sit on the solutions for a couple days and then resolve the exercise without looking at the solutions email.
I don&rsquo;t expect this though.</p>

<h4>What if the exercises are too easy for me and I don&rsquo;t learn anything new?</h4>

<p>If you find the exercises are too easy, email me and I&rsquo;ll see what I can do.
I&rsquo;ve developed quite a few exercises over the last year and I may be able to work with you to ensure the exercises you get are a good fit for your experience level.
If it turns out that Python Morsels simply isn&rsquo;t for you, I&rsquo;ll refund you.</p>

<h4>What if the exercises suddenly get too hard for me?</h4>

<p>If the exercises turn out to be too challenging for you, either immediately or eventually, email me.
I plan to create some easier tracks for Python Morsels eventually (there&rsquo;s certainly demand for this) and I may have some suitable exercises to send to you.
If Python Morsels doesn&rsquo;t suit your needs and I can&rsquo;t easily fix the problem, I&rsquo;ll send you a refund.</p>

<h2>Ready to start a weekly skill-building habit?</h2>

<p>Are you ready to start 52 weeks of Python skill-building for $96 (normally $192)?
That&rsquo;s less than $2/week and about one hour of your time each week (which really is the bigger cost here).</p>

<p>If you have questions that I didn&rsquo;t address above, please <a href="mailto:tr%65y%40&amp;#116;%72%75&amp;#116;%68%66u&amp;#108;&amp;#46;&amp;#116;&amp;#101;c%68&amp;#110;%6flo%67%79">email me</a> and say what you&rsquo;re thinking/feeling.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in seeing the opinion of someone who has worked through Python Morsels exercises, see the testimonials <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/">on the homepage</a> or take a look at what some of my Python Morsels friends have said about it on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewsForge/status/1018597131496710144">Andrew Pinkham</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/PavelAnni/status/963778202605932544">Pavel Anni</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jmwatt3/status/1035314897280794629">Jason Wattier</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/abqpythonista/status/976202006405595136">Ben Jones</a>).</p>
