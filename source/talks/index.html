<h2 id="talks">Long-Form Talks</h2>

<p>I prefer 5 minute lightning talks and 3 hour workshops, but I do also sometimes give long-form 25-30 minute talks.  You can find a few of my recorded talks below.</p>

  <h3>Comprehensible Comprehensions</h3>

  <iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5_cJIcgM7rw?t=52s" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

  <p>This talk is on list comprehensions and generator expressions in Python.  In this talk we take a look at how why Python has comprehensions, how they work, how to make them readable, and when to turn comprehensions into generator expressions.</p>

  <p>
  In this talk we dive into some common (and not so common) gotchas in Python.
  This talk was heavily inspired by questions asked by my corporate training students and tweets I made on the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23pythonoddity">#pythonoddity hashtag</a>.

<h2 id="tutorials">Workshops & Tutorials</h2>

<p>Interactive workshops and tutorials are my preferred in-person teaching style.  Recorded workshops aren't as valuable as the in-person experience, but they can still be valuable!  You can take a look at a few recordings of my workshops past below.</p>

  <h3>Using List Comprehensions and Generator Expressions for Data Processing</h3>
  <iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_6U1XoxyyBY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  <p>This is a 3 hour tutorial I taught at PyCon 2018 on some Python-specific looping constructs that are particularly helpful when processing data.  The workshop material can be found at <a href="http://pycon2018.trey.io">pycon2018.trey.io</a>.</p>

  <h3>Readable Regular Expressions</h3>
  <iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0sOfhhduqks" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  <p>This is a 3 hour tutorial I taught at PyCon 2017 on regular expressions.  We discussed what regular expressions are good for, how to write them, how they work in Python specifically, and some often overlooked techniques for making regular expressions more readable.  The workshop material can be found at <a href="http://pycon2017.regex.training/">pycon2017.regex.training</a>.</p>

<h2>Lightning Talks</h2>
