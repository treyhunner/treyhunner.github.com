<h2>What I do</h2>

<p>
I help organizations dive deeper into Python, through <a href="http://truthful.technology">custom-fit team training</a>.
My training sessions are exercise-heavy, with a focus on code quality and learning-by-doing.
</p>

<p>
I also help individuals dive deeper into Pythonic coding through my Python skill-building service, <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/">Python Morsels</a>.
</p>

<p>
I've done consulting in both Python and Django since 2009 and I've been focused exclusively on training and teaching since 2015.
</p>

<p>
I've been a director at the Python Software Foundation, a Django Girls workshop co-organizer, and a speaker at a number of conferences.
I love the Python community, I love the Python language, and <strong>I absolutely love teaching Python</strong>.
</p>

<h2>How I can help you</h2>
