## Biggest changes from 2024

I switched from Pocket Casts to Podcast Republic.
I'm not entirely satisfied with either.
I wish there was a podcast app that allowed me to easily maintain multiple queues/coming up-style playlists at once but wasn't so complex.

My LLM use changed this year, first with the discovery of Typing Mind (thanks to my friend [Kevin Markham][]) and later thanks to command-line LLM agents becoming a thing.

I also started using Hank Green's Focus Friend app.
Or maybe playing it, since it's a bit of a game plus pomodoro-style app in one.

I continue to *really appreciate* Kagi and have been getting more use out of both Raindrop and Obsidian this year (which were both new to me last year).

I've also been really enjoying using uv a bit more seriously than I was last year.
I didn't mention it above, but I've finally listened to Jeff's repeated [recommendations][jeff] to use [justfiles][just] and I'm loving those too.
