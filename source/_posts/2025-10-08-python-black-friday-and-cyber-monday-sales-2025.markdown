It's time for some **discounted** Python skill-building.

This is my **[eighth annual compilation](https://treyhunner.com/blog/categories/sales/)** of Python learning-related Black Friday & Cyber Monday deals.


## Python sales

This year, I know that the following folks are offering Black Friday sales:

- **[Python Morsels][]**: I'm offering lifetime access for the second time ever (more details below)
- **[Data School][]**: subscribe for $99/year to access Kevin's current 7 courses plus all his upcoming courses
- **[Talk Python][]**: the annual everything bundle, a special AI course bundle, and a discount on Michael Kennedy's Talk Python in Production book
- **[Mike Driscoll][]**: use code `BLACKISBACK` to get 50% off all his Python books and courses
- **[Reuven Lerner][]**: use code `BF2025` to get 20% off **annual subscriptions** to the **LernerPython+data** subscription tier

Likely additional sales:
