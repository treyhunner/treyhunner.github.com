I helped host a free Test-Driven Django Web Development workshop on <time date="2013-11-02">Saturday November 2</time> with [San Diego Python][pythonsd].  We created a series of tutorials demonstrating how to create a Django-powered blog while practicing test-driven development.  The [Python Software Foundation][psf] sponsored the event and the [Ansir Innovation Center][aicenter] provided a venue.

You can find the tutorials at http://bit.ly/pysd-tdd.  The tutorials are provided under a [CC BY-SA license][license] so you can reuse and modify them for your own purposes.

Tutorial markdown files and working source code may be found on [Github][source].  We plan to improve and extend these tutorials for a future workshop.  If you have ideas for improvements/additions or if you notice a bug, please submit an issue or open a pull request.
