I'm running [a sale][python morsels sale] that ends in 24 hours, but I'm not the only one.
This post is a compilation of the different Cyber Monday deals I've found related to Python and Python learning.


### Python Morsels, weekly skill-building for professional Pythonistas

[Python Morsels][] is my weekly Python skill-building service.

I'm offering something sort of like a "buy one get one free" sale this year.

You can pay $200 to get 2 redemption codes, each worth 12 months of Python Morsels.

You can use one code for yourself and give one to a friend.
Or you could be extra generous and give them both away to two friends.
Either way, 2 people are each getting one year's worth of weekly Python training.

You can find [more details on this sale here][python morsels sale].


### Data School's Machine Learning course

Kevin Markham of Data School is selling his "Machine Learning with Text in Python" course for $195 (it's usually $295).
You can find more details on this sale [on the Data School Black Friday post](https://www.dataschool.io/black-friday/).


### Talk Python Course Bundle

Michael Kennedy is selling a bundle that includes [every Talk Python course for $250](https://training.talkpython.fm/black-friday-2019).

There are 20 courses included in this bundle.
If you're into Python and you don't already own most of these courses, this bundle could be a really good deal for you.


### Reuven Lerner's Python courses

Reuven Lerner is offering a [50% off sale on his courses](https://lerner.co.il/2019/11/28/my-black-friday-sale-is-live-take-50-off-any-course-in-python-or-data-science/).
Reuven has courses on Python, Git, and regular expressions.

This sale also includes Reuven's [Weekly Python Exercise][], which is similar to [Python Morsels][], but has its own flavor.
You could sign up for both if you want double the weekly learning.
