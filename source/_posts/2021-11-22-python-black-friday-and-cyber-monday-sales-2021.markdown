This is my annual compilation post of Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals I've found related to **Python and Python learning**.

**Note**: Some sales likely aren't announced yet, so I will update this post on Black Friday and Cyber Monday.


### 50% off dozens of Python screencasts (Python Morsels)

Yes, the self-promotion comes first.

The Python Morsels Lite plan has evolved *a lot* since I first launched it and it's long overdue for a price increase.
This plan includes access to **over 90 Python screencasts** (a new one added each week) as well as a **monthly Python exercise** (your choice from novice to advanced Python).

From December 1, 2021 onward the price for the Python Morsels Lite plan will be $10/month or $100/year.
Until November 30, you can signup for **$5/month** or **$50/year** (and you'll lock-in that price for as long as you're subscribed).
This is the lowest price I'll ever offer this plan for.

**Save 50%** on [the Python Morsels Lite plan](https://www.pythonmorsels.com/watch-python-screencasts/) by signing up from now until Cyber Monday.

If you like Python Morsels, you might want to check out Reuven's Weekly Python exercise as well.
Both are based around exercise-driven learning.

Kevin Markham is offering 33% off his new course, [Python Essentials for Data Scientists](https://courses.dataschool.io/python-essentials-for-data-scientists?coupon=BLACKFRIDAY).
The course will be $33 instead of $49 from Black Friday through Cyber Monday.

### Talk Python course bundle

You can get every Talk Python course that's been made so far [for just $250](http://talkpython.fm/black-friday) (or less if you've bought previous bundles).

### More Sales To Watch Out For

**No Starch** press often offers Black Friday discounts on lots of [Python books](https://nostarch.com/catalog/python) (Al Sweigart, Eric Mathes, and more).

**PyBites** sometimes holds Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales.
Check [the PyBites site](https://pybit.es/) on Black Friday in case they're holding a sale.


### Lots of screencasts, exercises, books, and courses on sale

This blog post is not up-to-date yet.
**Check back on Black Friday** for more Python-related sales as I hear about them (and feel free to comment below if you find more).

Also don't go too wild on sales!
If you don't have time to work through a Python course, don't buy it.
If you're unlikely to ever read that Python book, don't get it.
And if you can't commit to weekly Python learning, don't subscribe!

Consider picking a few things that look like you'll actually use them, and buy them.
Python educators love your support, but we also like happy customers who use and love our services.

Also if you have money to spend but nothing to spend it on (that's a great problem to have...), do as Python educator [Allen Downey suggested](https://twitter.com/AllenDowney/status/1462856493716459526) and **donate to charity**.
You could [become a PSF member](https://psfmember.org/) or give to highly effective charities via [GiveWell](https://www.givewell.org/) or [The Life You Can Save](https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/).

If you have a question about [the Python Morsels sale](https://www.pythonmorsels.com/watch-python-screencasts/) please <a href='m&#97;&#105;l&#116;o&#58;he&#108;p&#64;&#112;%7&#57;th%6Fnmo&#114;s%6&#53;ls&#46;&#99;&#111;m'>email me</a>.
If you have a question about the other sales, reach out to the folks running it.

Happy coding!
