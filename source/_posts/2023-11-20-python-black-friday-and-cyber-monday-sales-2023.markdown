It's time for my annual compilation post of **Python learning deals**.
I've been compiling Python-related Black Friday & Cyber Monday sales [since 2018](https://treyhunner.com/blog/categories/sales/) and 2023's Python-related sales are coming up.


## Lifetime Python Morsels access for the price of two years

I'm kicking things off with [my sale][python morsels] on Python Morsels.
Python Morsels helps developers **deepen their Python skills** in a way that day-to-day coding simply can't.

Python Morsels is designed for:

- experienced developers frustrated with gaps in their Python knowledge
- self-taught programmers seeking courage and confidence in their Python abilities
- experienced Python developers hoping to dive even deeper

If you saw yourself in that list and you plan to use Python heavily for at least a few more years, I highly recommend checking out [the Python Morsels sale][python morsels].

From now through November 27, you can get **lifetime access** to Python Morsels for a one-time fee.
Python Morsels usually costs **$240/year** but lifetime access is **only $480**.
This is the best sale I've ever offered on Python Morsels and I'm guessing this might be the best Python-related deal this year.
