Ever wished you could take an **Intro to Python training** with me, but you don't work for a company with a generous training budget?
I'm running a Python-learning program just for this situation.

[Python High Five][] is a 10-week Python jumpstart program that starts **this September**.


## Set aside the time to learn ‚åö

One of the biggest problems for folks starting to learn Python is **setting aside the time**.
And even if you *do* manage to set aside the time, you'll often hit a roadblock where you feel **confused**.

Python High Five is a way to keep a **daily learning habit** *and* to **get help** when find yourself stuck.

This program is based around **daily practice**.
Monday through Friday you'll pick **30 minutes** from your schedule, at any time that works you.
During those 30 minutes, you'll watch a 5 minute video, work on the day's exercise, and reflect on your progress.


## The most effective learning is hands-on üñêÔ∏è

Python High Five is all about learning through **writing Python code**.
Each week we'll dive deeper into Python, building upon what we've learned so far.

When you find yourself stuck you can get help through an asynchronous **group chat** and weekly **office hour** sessions.
In addition to our weekly office hours together, I'll check the chat each day, respond to questions, and provide guidance.


## Proven learning techniques behind the scenes üìù

The daily check-ins allow for daily **accountability**.
The group chat also provides both a community of peers to rely on, and **guidance from an experienced Python trainer** (me).

We'll also be using proven learning techniques behind the scenes:

- **Retrieval practice**: you don't learn by putting information into your head, but by trying to take it out; for Python learning, that means writing code.
- **Spaced repetition**: cramming is less effective than learning spaced out over time, which is why we'll spend 30 minutes each weekday instead of spending a few hours every week.
- **Interleaving**: each day's exercise isn't predictably themed because a bit of unpredictability can be *really* improve learning outcomes.
- **Elaboration**: your daily check-in isn't *just* about reflection: it's also a helpful learning tool!

Plus, we'll be working through curriculum I've been developing and iterating on for many years.
I have taught these topics in many different settings to folks from *many* different backgrounds.


## Form a daily learning habit üîÅ

Any 10-week program will be *just the start* of a Python learning habit.
You'll need to keep up your Python after Python High Five ends, either by promptly applying your skills to a new project or diving deeper into Python with continued daily practice.

That's why I'm offering an **80% discount** for High Five attendees on one year of [Python Morsels](https://www.pythonmorsels.com), which is my skill-building service designed to help **deepen your Python skills every week**.
