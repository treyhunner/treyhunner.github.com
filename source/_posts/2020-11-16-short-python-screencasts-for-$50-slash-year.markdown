I'm going to publish a short Python screencast every week.
These will be concise, single-topic screencasts that won't waste your time.
Each screencast will be at most 5 minutes in length.

If you're a life-long learner who uses Python and doesn't have a wealth of time for learning, read on.


### What is this?

This is a **weekly screencast subscription** which is part of Python Morsels, a Python exercise subscription service I run.

With this subscription you'll receive access to a growing archive of Python screencasts (**at least one new screencast each week**).
If you enjoy the articles on my blog or the teaching style I use in my PyCon tutorials, you'll probably enjoy the format I use in my screencasts.

**Don't like video? Than's okay!**
If you prefer to watch but not listen, each screencast also includes English captions.
And if you **prefer text over video**, you can read the **mini-blog post that's included with each screencast**, which acts as nearly a text-based equivalent to the video.


### What are the screencasts like?

Each screencast will be **concise** and **short**.
Here are two examples: [variables are pointers][] (2 minutes) and [the 2 types of "change"][] (3 minutes).
You can find more example screencasts on the Python Morsels [screencasts page][].

**What topics will the screencasts be on?**
Functions, classes, scope, operator overloading, decorators, exception handling, and lots more.
The topics will range from beginner to advanced.

**What will you *not* record screencasts on?**
The screencasts may include standard library modules, but core language features will be showcased primarily.
These screencasts will all be focused on Python itself, not on third-party libraries.
So I won't do screencasts on Pandas, Numpy, Django, or other third-party libraries.

**How many screencasts will be freely shareable?**
Some screencasts will limited to subscribers and some will be available to non-subscribers, but I don't know what the breakdown will be yet.


### You'll also get get occasional Python exercises

This subscription is part of Python Morsels, an exercise subscription service I run.
So in addition to the succinct Python screencast each week, you'll also receive **one Python exercise each month**.

If you've ever worked through one of my PyCon tutorials, or attended a training session from me, you'll know that the best part of my curriculum is the exercises.
I spend a *lot* of time coming up with Python exercises that are interesting and complex **without being overly complicated**.
You don't need to work through the monthly exercises, but I do recommend it.
We don't learn by putting information into our heads; we learn by trying to retrieve information from our heads, and writing code is a great way to practice informational retrieval.


### This subscription is $50/year for a limited time

I don't have a large archive of past screencasts for new users to peruse (though I will in time) so I'm offering this service for a comparatively low price of $50/year.
I have loose plans to increase the price in 2021, but as an early user **your price will always be $50/year** (as my way of thanking you for being an early supporter of these screencasts).

If you're not sure whether this is for you, [sign up for Python Morsels][] and try it out for a month.


### Why pay for this when there's a lot of great free Python videos out there?

Why am I charging money for this?

There's really one reason: **you're trading money for time**.
This is a tradeoff I've grown an appreciation for (one which would baffle a younger version of myself).

This time-money tradeoff comes in a few forms:

1. You will never see any ads on Python Morsels. Not in videos, not in the sidebar. You're not the product, the screencasts are.
2. No filler content. I'll keep these videos concise and ramble-free (there's no ad revenue to incentivize unnecessarily long videos)
3. I have a unique perspective and unique expertise: I'm a long-time Python user with opinions and preferencs, but teaching is my business and I've been told I'm a pretty great teacher.

Before you do sign up, watch [a few of the current screencasts][screencasts page] and see whether my teaching style is for you.
If it isn't, that's okay!
If it is, I think you'll find the next year's worth of screencasts will be a worthwhile! üòÅ


### Student discounts? Team subscriptions? Other questions?

I offer discounts to students, though my discounts are *not only* for students.
My standard [discount policy][] is income-tiered, so that anyone making less than $60,000 USD per year is eligible for a discount.
I also offer situation-specific discounts, so please don't hesitate to ask for a discount if you need one.

I also have team subscriptions (so you can pay for your whole team in one invoice).
Just [fill out this form][] to get started setting up a subscription for your team.
