I'm offering a service to help **life-long Python learners** manufacture ah-ha moments.

A few years ago at my local Python meetup I was discussing how function arguments work (they're [call-by-assignment][] a.k.a. [call by object][call-by-sharing]).
A friend spoke up to clarify: "but it doesn't work that way for numbers and strings, right?"
I said "I'm pretty sure it works like this for everything".

After some quiet Googling, my friend declared "I've been using Python for over a decade and I never knew it worked this way".
They'd suddenly realized *their mental model of the Python world* differed from Python's model of itself.
They'd experienced an "ah-ha moment".

I'm going to publish **at least one short Python screencast every week** to help *manufacture* **Python ah-ha moments**.
These will be single-topic screencasts that **won't waste your time**.

So, if you're a life-long learner who uses Python and doesn't have a wealth of time for learning, read on.


### What is this?

With this subscription you'll receive access to a growing archive of Python screencasts (**at least one new screencast each week**).
If you enjoy my [articles][] or my [talks and tutorials][], you'll probably enjoy the format I use in my screencasts.

**Don't like video?** That's okay!
Each screencast is captioned and includes **a mini-blog post** which is nearly **a text-based equivalent** to the video.


### What are the screencasts like?

Each screencast will be **concise** and short, under 6 minutes.
Examples include [variables are pointers][] (2 mins) and [the 2 types of "change"][] (3 mins), plus [others here][screencasts page].

**What topics will the screencasts be on?**
Functions, classes, scope, operator overloading, decorators, exception handling, and more.
Screencasts will focus on Python core, not third-party libraries (no Pandas, Numpy, or Django).
Topics will range from beginner to advanced.

**Will the screencasts be freely shareable?**
Some screencasts will be limited to subscribers and some will be available to non-subscribers, with a yet-to-be-decided breakdown between the two.


### You'll also get get occasional Python exercises

This weekly screencast subscription is part of [Python Morsels][], an exercise subscription service I run.
In addition to weekly screencasts, you'll also get **one Python exercise each month**.

If you've taken [my PyCon tutorials][] or attended [my trainings][], you know exercises are the best part of my curriculum.
I spend a lot of time making new exercises because we learn by attempting to retrieve information from our heads (through practice), not by putting information *into* our heads.

Python Morsels exercises are both interesting and **complex but not complicated**.
You don't need to work through the monthly exercises, but I do recommend it.


### This subscription is $50/year for a limited time

I'm offering this service for a comparatively low price of $50/year because I don't have a large archive of screencasts yet.
I have plans to increase the price in 2021, but as an early user **your price will always be $50/year**.

If you're not sure whether this is for you, [sign up to try it out for free][sign up].


### Why pay for this when there's a lot of great free Python videos out there?

Why am I charging money for this?

There's really one reason: **you're trading money for time**.
This is a tradeoff I've grown an appreciation for (one which would baffle a younger version of myself).

This time-money tradeoff comes in a few forms:

1. You will never see any ads on Python Morsels: you're not the product, the screencasts are
2. No filler content or rambling (no ad revenue means no need for long videos)
3. I have unique expertise and perspective: teaching Python is my business and I'm good at it

Watch some of [the current screencasts][screencasts page] before signing up.
If my teaching style isn't for you, that's okay!
But if my teaching style *is* for you, I think you'll find **the next year's worth of screencasts** will be worthwhile! üòÅ


### Student discounts? Team subscriptions? Other questions?

My standard [discount policy][] is income-tiered: if you make less than $60,000 USD annually, you're eligible.
I also offer situation-specific discounts, so please **ask for a discount if you need one**.

If you're paying through your employer, note that there are **team subscriptions** too.
Just [fill out this form][] to get started setting up a subscription for your team.
