It's that time of year againâ€¦ time for my annual compilation post of **Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals for learning Python**.


## Save up to $108 a year on Python Morsels

Of course I'm going to kick things off with my own sale. ðŸ˜‰

[Python Morsels][] helps developers **deepen their Python skills** in a way that day-to-day coding simply can't.

Python Morsels is specifically crafted for:

- experienced developers frustrated with gaps in their Python knowledge
- self-taught programmers seeking courage and confidence in their Python abilities
- intermediate-level Python learners trying to deepen skills

If you saw yourself in that list, subscribe now before prices increase on November 29, 2022!

## Python books, courses, templates, and exercises

There are a *lot* of Python-related sales going on this year.
Note that some of the below sales include courses, some include books, some include templates (Itamar's Docker templates for example) and some include a mix of different learning products.

- **[Reuven Lerner][reuven]**: Reuven's Python courses are 40% off this week with the coupon `BF2022`
- **[Talk Python][]**: Get all Talk Python courses in one $249 bundle
- **Sundeep Agarwal**: Sundeep's [all books bundle is 64% off](https://learnbyexample.gumroad.com/l/all-books/FestiveOffer) (it's $10), the [Learn by example Python bundle](https://learnbyexample.gumroad.com/l/python-bundle/FestiveOffer) is 80% off (it's $3), and [Practice Python Projects](https://learnbyexample.gumroad.com/l/py_projects/FestiveOffer) is free!
- **[Itamar Turner-Trauring][docker]**: Itamar's Docker packaging products for Python are all 25% off through November with the code `FALL22`

- **[Udemy][]**: various Python courses are also on sale on Udemy right now, including Al Sweigart's [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python course](https://www.udemy.com/course/automate/)


## Python learning subscriptions

I use a subscription model for [Python Morsels][] because subscriptions (when done well) can encourage habitual learning, which is often more effective than binge-learning.
But Python Morsels isn't the only subscription-based Python learning platform.

Here sales on other learning subscriptions:

- **[O'Reilly Media][oreilly]** subscriptions are $200 off with the coupon [CYBERWEEK22][oreilly]
- **[Dunder Data][]** subscriptions (by Ted Petrou) are 40% off (normally $399), plus an extra 50% off for completing 3 certificates within 3 months
- **[DataCamp][]** has a 50% off sale on their annual subscriptions right now as well

Also here's a Python-related service that's on sale (a subscription product, not a learning service):

- **Sourcery**: [Sourcery Pro][] is 33% off for the first 12 months with coupon `BLACKFRIDAY2022`


## Django sales

Adam Johnson compiled many [**Django-related Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales**][adam post].

Here's a quick summary:

- Will Vincent is offering 50% off a bundle for newer Django developers ([sale](https://wsvincent.gumroad.com/l/bhylo/blackfriday2022))
- Adam Johnson is offering 50% off his books for experienced Django developers ([announcement][adam post])
- Test Driven is selling a discounted bundle of courses on Django REST Framework, Celery, and search ([sale](https://testdriven.io/bundle/django-black-friday/))
