This is my annual compilation post of Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals I've found related to **Python and Python learning**.

Note that Cyber Monday is a week away, so most sales aren't yet announced.
I'll update this page as the details of each sale is announced.


## Python Morsels sale

Python Morsels, my Python skill-honing system is on sale through Cyber Monday.

Python Morsels helps developers **deepen their Python skills** in a way that day-to-day coding doesn't.

I recommend signing up for Python Morsels if you are:

- an experienced developer, frustrated with gaps in your Python knowledge
- a self-taught programmer seeking courage and confidence in your Python abilities
- or an intermediate-level Python learner trying to deepen your Python skills

You can **save up to $108 per year** by subscribing now.
