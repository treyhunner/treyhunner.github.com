It's that time of year againâ€¦ time for my annual compilation post of Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals for learning Python.

Note that Cyber Monday is a week away, so most sales aren't yet announced. I'll update this post when more details become available; it shouldn't be a long wait!


## Save up to $108 a year on Python Morsels

Of course I'm going to kick things off with my own sale. ðŸ˜‰

[Python Morsels][] helps developers **deepen their Python skills** in a way that day-to-day coding simply can't.

Python Morsels is specifically crafted for:

- experienced developers frustrated with gaps in their Python knowledge
- self-taught programmers seeking courage and confidence in their Python abilities
- intermediate-level Python learners trying to deepen skills

If you saw yourself in that list, subscribe now before prices increase on November 29, 2022!

## Python books, courses, templates, and exercises

- **[Reuven Lerner][reuven]**: Reuven's Python courses are 40% off this week with the coupon `BF2022`
- **Sundeep Agarwal**: Sundeep's [all books bundle is 64% off](https://learnbyexample.gumroad.com/l/all-books/FestiveOffer) (it's $10), the [Learn by example Python bundle](https://learnbyexample.gumroad.com/l/python-bundle/FestiveOffer) is 80% off (it's $3), and [Practice Python Projects](https://learnbyexample.gumroad.com/l/py_projects/FestiveOffer) is free!
- **[Itamar Turner-Trauring][docker]**: Itamar's Docker packaging products for Python are all 25% off through November with the code `FALL22`
- **[Mike Driscoll][driscoll]**: Mike is offering $10 off any of his books this year with the coupon code `black2022`
- **[Pragmatic Bookshelf][]**: save 40% on Brian Okken's PyTest book or any other Pragmatic Bookshelf book with the coupon code `turkeysale2022`
- **[Udemy][]**: various Python courses are also on sale on Udemy right now, including Al Sweigart's [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python course](https://www.udemy.com/course/automate/)


## Python learning subscriptions

I use a subscription model for [Python Morsels][] because subscriptions (when done well) can encourage habitual learning, which is often more effective than binge-learning.

Here are 3 subscriptions that also involve Python learning:

- **[O'Reilly Media][oreilly]** subscriptions are $200 off with the coupon [CYBERWEEK22][oreilly]
- **[Ted Petrou][dunder data]** is offering 40% off his Dunder Data subscriptions (normally $399), plus an extra 50% off for completing 3 certificates within 3 months
- **[DataCamp][]** has a 50% off sale on their annual subscriptions right now as well

And here's a Python-related service that's on sale (a subscription product, not a learning service):

- **Sourcery**: [Sourcery Pro][] is 33% off for the first 12 months with coupon `BLACKFRIDAY2022`


## Django sales

Adam Johnson compiled many [**Django-related Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales**][adam post].

Here's a quick summary:

- Will Vincent is offering 50% off a bundle for newer Django developers ([sale](https://wsvincent.gumroad.com/l/bhylo/blackfriday2022))
- Adam Johnson is offering 50% off his books for experienced Django developers ([announcement][adam post])
- Test Driven is selling a discounted bundle of courses on Django REST Framework, Celery, and search ([sale](https://testdriven.io/bundle/django-black-friday/))

Plus other discounted books, apps, templates, and services from others: [read Adam's full post][adam post] for more details on the Django-related sales this year.


## Possible sales that aren't (yet) announced

I'm watching out for sales from these folks as well and will update this post with more details if/when more sales are announced:

- **Talk Python**: Michael Kennedy usually offers all his courses in one $250 bundle each year ([this link *should* point to the sale on Friday][talk python])
- **Matt Harrison**: Matt often offers a sale on his books and courses ([check his store here][metasnake])
- **PyBites**: Bob and Julian at [PyBites][] often offer a sale
- **No Starch**: [No Starch][] usually holds a sale on their books, including many popular Python

I'll update the above links as more sales are announced.
