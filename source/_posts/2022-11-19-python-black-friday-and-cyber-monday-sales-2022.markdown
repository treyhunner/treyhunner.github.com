It's that time of year againâ€¦ time for my annual compilation post of Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals for learning Python.

Note that Cyber Monday is a week away, so most sales aren't yet announced. I'll update this post when more details become available; it shouldn't be a long wait!

Of course I'm going to kick things off with my own sale. ðŸ˜‰


## Save up to $108 a year on Python Morsels

Python Morsels, my Python skill-honing system is on sale through Cyber Monday.

Python Morsels helps developers **deepen their Python skills** in a way that day-to-day coding simply can't.

Python Morsels is specifically crafted for:

- experienced developers frustrated with gaps in their Python knowledge
- self-taught programmers seeking courage and confidence in their Python abilities
- intermediate-level Python learners trying to deepen skills

If you saw yourself described in that list, subscribe now before prices increase on November 29, 2022!
