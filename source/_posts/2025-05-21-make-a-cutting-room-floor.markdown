All writers need a **cutting room floor**.

I have never written a book, an academic paper, or a journal article.
And yet I *do* write.

I write emails, I write blog posts, I write screencast scripts, I journal, I write talks, and I write curriculum for my Python trainings.

When I write, I need a place to put text that *may* not make the cut in a final draft.
I call this place the "cutting room floor".


## How I write: draft, research, edit

Before sharing what I mean by a "cutting room floor", I need to explain *how* I write.

I tend to write in 2-3 stages:

1. Draft: writing *more* words, ideally without deleting or modifying
2. Research: discovering facts playing with possible examples
3. Edit: deleting, rearranging, and modifying words

When **drafting**, I try to barf out words quickly and, ideally, without any editing at all.
I often do this by setting a 25 - 60 minute timer and then writing thoughts as they pour out of my head.

When **researching**, I'm looking things up online, trying out code in a text editor, and sometimes playing with ideas in an abstract way.
This phase sometimes looks like traditional "research" and sometimes includes a mix of research and brainstorming.

When **editing**, I'm re-reading my words and attempting to turn them into something *good*.
The first draft is sometimes pretty close to what I ultimately end up with, but sometimes it's *very different* from what I eventually publish.

Sometimes I draft and then edit without any research.
Sometimes I research first.
And often I bounce back and forth between these different tasks.

I try to keep my drafting time *distinct* from my research and editing time.
When drafting, my thoughts aren't always sensible, but they're *something*.
It's often easier to edit a bunch of *something* into something *sensible* than it is to write something sensible in the first place.

It's *very* tempting to start researching or editing while I'm drafting.
I try to counter that temptation by writing `TODO insert blah here` whenever I feel that something is needed but that *thing* needs further research before I can write a certain paragraph or so about it.


## The "cutting room floor" is about editing

When I'm **editing** my writing, I frequently find it challenging to remove certain sections.
I often feel like I wrote something important, even while acknowledging that it may not fit well within the larger piece I'm writing.
I often don't realize that an idea or a bit of writing doesn't fit until I'm far into editing.

The **cutting room floor** is a way to **save** a specific bit of writing while also acknowledging that I may never use it.

When using a "cutting room floor", I select a paragraph or a whole section of text and I "cut" it out of my writing and then "paste" it at the bottom of the document under a "Cutting room floor" section.
Or sometimes I'll paste it in a separate file, called something like `cutting-room-floor.md`.

I *do* usually delete that file or that section from my text, but not until the end.
Even when my text is all version-controlled, it feels much less *final* and *scary* to move some text into a (possibly temporary) "cutting room floor" than it feels to delete the text entirely.


## Kill your darlings... or set them aside?

The noun "[cutting room floor][]" relates to the verb "[kill your darlings][]".

While "kill your darlings" may sound like a violent phrase, it essentially means "don't be afraid to remove things you like".

In my [PyOhio keynote](https://trey.io/pyohio2024) in 2024, I originally had a whole section on cognitive dissonance.
This section involved my own personal experience with cognitive dissonance and I spent a lot of time trying to make this section coherent, thoughtful, and impactful.
That was originally my favorite section of the talk, but I eventually **deleted that entire section from the talk**.

As I iterated versions of the talk, that "darling" section made less and less sense within the context of the whole talk.
At some point I realized that the section was only *in* the talk because it was a **darling** for me.

That section meant something special to me, but it just didn't fit.
Reluctantly, I moved it to the cutting room floor.
I kept iterating and the eventual talk was *better* because I cut that "darling" section out.

My **cutting room floor** allowed me to **kill a darling** by setting it to the side.
I could always add it back in later, but ultimately, I never did.
Once it was removed, I knew the talk made more sense.


## Allow yourself to delete everything

Having a "cutting room floor" gives me **permission to delete** any section of any talk, screencast, or article I write.

A "cut" section isn't *gone*.
It's just been moved to the cutting room floor... possibly just temporarily!
I can always add the section back in later if I want.

The cutting room floor could be thought of as a sort of graveyard, but it can *also* be a place of inspiration.
I *rarely* add sections back into my talk after I cut them, but I *do* often spend time re-drafting a new section that replaces a section that I had cut.
Sometimes I'll even look at the text in my cutting room floor, borrowing the words I like as I write replacement text.

Instead of saying an emphatic "NO" by deleting permanently, I can say "not right now" by moving text to the cutting room floor.
For me, "not right now" is often a lot easier for me to say than "no".

So during *your* editing session, give yourself permission to cut by **making a cutting room floor**.
