I've just recently launched a self-paced introduction to Python that is **extremely hands-on**.
It's called **[Python Jumpstart][]** and it's based on introductory Python curriculum that I have been iterating on for years.

## Learn Python by writing Python code ‚úç

We *do not* learn by putting information into the brain.
Our brains simply don't retain knowledge that way.

Learning happens from repeatedly attempting to retrieve information *from* the brain.
When it comes to Python, that means **writing Python code**.

So unlike most Python courses, Python Jumpstart is *not* focused on watching videos and rewriting code seen within videos.
Instead, this new Python course is based around **learning Python by writing Python code**.


## How Python Jumpstart is structured üî¨

Python Jumpstart includes learning Python by solving **46 short Python exercises**.

Before each exercise, you'll watch a 5 minute video explaining a new Python topic.
You'll then attempt the exercise to put one or more Python topics into practice.

You won't solve many of the exercises on your first try and *that's okay*.
These exercises are designed to be revisited a few times over the course of weeks, until you're satisfied with your solution.


## This is not a sprint üìÜ

This structured path to Python proficiency, includes:

- Carefully crafted exercises that build real understanding
- Short, detailed explanations that *won't* waste your time
- A proven teaching approach that focuses on active learning
- Spaced repetition to help concepts stick

This is not a course for impatient or passive learners.
Learning takes **repetitive effort** spaced over many days and this course is structured to embrace that fact.

If you spend **30 minutes** on Python Jumpstart each day, I estimate that you'll complete this course in **about 7 weeks**.
You'll spend the large majority of that time writing Python code.

This course *will* take time, but it will be time well-spent.


## Launch week special: 50% off until December 2 ‚è∞

Through Monday December 2, 2024, you can get lifetime access to [Python Jumpstart][] for **$99**.
After this launch week, Python Jumpstart will be **$199**.
