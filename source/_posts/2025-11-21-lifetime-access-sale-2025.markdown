If you code in Python regularly, you’re already learning new things everyday.

You hit a wall, or something breaks. Then you search around, spend some hours on Stack Overflow, and eventually, you figure it out.

But **this kind of learning is unstructured. It’s reactive, instead of intentional.** 

You fix the problem at hand, but the underlying gaps in your knowledge remain unaddressed.


## A Smarter, Truly Intentional Way to Master Python

Python Morsels gives you **a structured, yet hands-on way to improve your Python skills** everyday:

* Notice significant, meaningful progress with as little as 30 minutes a week  
* Learn to naturally think more Pythonically   
* Explore new, outside-the-box approaches to problem-solving  
* Challenge yourself to get outside your comfort zone regularly

Usually, you have to pay monthly or yearly to get access to Python Morsels, because **I’m adding new learning resources to it almost every week**. 

But right now, you can lock in lifetime access with a single one-time payment, and **keep learning for FREE** for as long as you want\!


## But How Does It Actually Work?

Python Morsels is very different from other learning systems.

It’s basically **a gym for your Python muscles**. Come in for quick training sessions, put in the reps, keep pushing yourself, and walk away a little stronger every time.

When you sign up for Python Morsels, you’ll choose your current Python skill level, from novice to advanced. 

Based on your skill level, **each Monday, I’ll send you a personalized routine** with:

* a short screencast to watch (or read)  
* a multi-part exercise to move you outside your comfort zone  
* a mini exercise that you can accomplish in just 10 minutes  
* links to dive deeper into subsequent screencasts and exercises

All these resources are personally recorded or written by me, accessible to you forever without any ongoing cost, when you sign up for Lifetime Access— but it’s only available until December 1st, 2025\!


## And How Many Resources Does Python Morsels Offer?

Python Morsels has grown a lot over the past 8 years. Currently, Python Morsels has:

* 235+ Video Lessons (or screencasts, as I call them)  
* 262+ Hands-On Exercises (with solution walkthroughs)  
* 500+ Optional Bonuses (to challenge every skill level)  
* 303+ Articles Organized Topic-Wise (if you prefer reading)

 I’ll be sending you personalized recommendations every week, but you can use these resources however they fit your routine

They work as learning guides, hands-on practice sessions, quick cheatsheets, long-term reference material, or quick Python workouts.

In addition to this, Python Morsels also gives you access to:

* Python Jumpstart \- a structured course for beginners  
* Additional Deep-Dive Courses \- structured tracks to master a concept  
* Exercise Paths \- topic-based exercises to strengthen a specific skill

Because Python Morsels runs as an active subscription service, I’m always adding new screencasts, new exercises, and updated material on a weekly or monthly cycle.

But this Black Friday, you can get lifetime access and enjoy every update, forever, at no extra cost.


## But Is Lifetime Access Really Worth It?

Remember gyms? Do they ever offer lifetime memberships? 

Absolutely not. 

Because gyms have ongoing costs. They upgrade equipment, maintain facilities, and need recurring revenue to keep everything running.

Python Morsels (your Python workout gym) works the same way. 

I’m continually **improving and updating** Python Morsels**.** 

I regularly write new articles, record new screencasts, create new exercises, and keep the entire library growing. I also keep everything up-to-date with each new Python release, incorporating newly added features and retiring end-of-life'd Python versions.

That is why **I almost never offer lifetime access. (I’ve only offered it once before in 8 years)**

But this Black Friday, as a way to give back to the community that has supported me for so long…

I’m giving you a chance to **lock in lifetime access for a one-time payment**, so you can keep learning and upskilling in Python without any ongoing costs.
