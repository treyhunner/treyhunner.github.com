If you code in Python regularly, you're already learning new things everyday.

You hit a wall, or something breaks. Then you search around, spend some hours on Stack Overflow, and eventually, you figure it out.

**But this kind of learning is unstructured. It's reactive, instead of intentional.**

You fix the problem at hand, but the underlying gaps in your knowledge remain unaddressed.


## A more structured way to improve your Python skills

Python Morsels gives you **a structured, hands-on way to improve your Python skills** through weekly practice:

* Notice significant progress with as little as 30 minutes a week
* Learn to naturally think more Pythonically
* Explore new approaches to problem-solving
* Challenge yourself to get outside your comfort zone regularly

Python Morsels is a subscription service because **I'm adding new learning resources almost every week**.

But through December 1st, you can get **[lifetime access][]** for a one-time payment.


## How it works

When you sign up for Python Morsels, you'll choose your current Python skill level, from novice to advanced.

Based on your skill level, **each Monday I'll send you a personalized routine** with:

* a short screencast to watch (or read)
* a multi-part exercise to move you outside your comfort zone
* a mini exercise that you can accomplish in just 10 minutes
* links to dive deeper into subsequent screencasts and exercises

Think of Python Morsels as a gym for your Python skills: you come in for quick training sessions, put in the reps, and make a little more progress each time.

All these resources are accessible to you forever, and with lifetime access you'll never pay another subscription fee.


## What Python Morsels includes

Python Morsels has grown a lot over the past 8 years. Currently, Python Morsels has:

* 235+ Video Lessons (or screencasts, as I call them)
* 262+ Hands-On Exercises (with solution walkthroughs)
* 500+ Optional Bonuses (to challenge every skill level)
* 303+ Articles Organized Topic-Wise (if you prefer reading)

I'll be sending you personalized recommendations every week, but you can use these resources however they fit your routine: as learning guides, hands-on practice sessions, quick cheatsheets, long-term reference material, or quick Python workouts.

In addition to this, Python Morsels also gives you access to:

* Python Jumpstart - a structured course for beginners
* Additional Deep-Dive Courses - structured tracks to master a concept
* Exercise Paths - topic-based exercises to strengthen a specific skill

Because Python Morsels runs as an active subscription service, I'm always adding new screencasts, new exercises, and updated material on a weekly or monthly cycle. I also keep everything up-to-date with each new Python release, incorporating newly added features and retiring end-of-life'd Python versions.


## Lock in lifetime access

Python Morsels usually costs **$240/year** but you can get **lifetime access** through December 1st for a one-time payment. I've only offered lifetime access **once before** in 8 years.

If you've been on the fence about subscribing to Python Morsels or want to invest in building a daily learning habit, this is a good time to do it.
