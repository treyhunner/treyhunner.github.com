My name is Trey Hunner and I help Python developers level-up their skills through [Python Morsels][], my weekly Python exercise service.

I also hold Python trainings for teams through my one-person corporate training company, [Truthful Technology LLC][].
These trainings are always hands-on (like my [tutorials][], not my [talks][]).

You can scroll down to see a list of the some popular Python articles I've written below, but please remember that watching talks and reading articles is **not the most effective way to learn**.
Learning comes through practice.

<h2>Practice Python every week with Python Morsels</h2>

We don't learn by putting information into our heads.
We learn by trying to retrieve information from our heads.
So practice is pretty much the only way to learn.

I made Python Morsels to help working Python developers grow their skills every week through deliberate practice.

As a Python Morsels subscriber, every Monday I'll send you a new exercise based on your skill level.
These exercises are meant to push you slightly outside of your comfort zone, gradually expanding your abilities each week.

I recommend allotting a total of 1-2 hours each week for Python practice via Python Morsels.
